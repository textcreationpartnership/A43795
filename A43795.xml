         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Lthough in ſo ſmall a Tractate, it may be thought needleſs to give an account of the occaſion thereof; yet I think my ſelf obliged for your further ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, to do it briefly. The Author having been lately in <hi>Holland,</hi> found what the <hi>Zeelanders</hi> had done in the late Revolutions, miſunderſtood by ſome, and variouſly cenſured by others; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thought it worth his pains, fairly and modeſtly to vindicate the ſame. And the rather, becauſe he foreſees various pretexts will be deduced thence, and divers interpretations be made thereof, which the Author hopes by his declaring the true intent and meaning, to free it from. That ſo all thoſe, whoſe Curioſity or Intereſt leads them to inquire, might be acquainted with the true Grounds and Reaſons thereof; and that neither the propenſity of ſome to the <hi>French,</hi> nor the prejudice and paſſion of others againſt the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> might make us run blindfold upon our ruine; but that we may diſcern our true <hi>Intereſt,</hi> and purſue it as occaſion ſhall require. For as all affection to that which is not our real Intereſt, ſo all averſation from that which is, is madneſs and folly; which clouds Reaſon, precipitates Counſels, runs us upon extreams, and drives us into inevitable deſtruction, many times before we are aware.</p>
            <p>I know ſome will be apt to ſay, What need of this now? The Storm is over, and the ſuppoſition of inability to defend our felves out of doors. If I thought ſo, I aſſure you I ſhould neither trouble my ſelf, nor others any further. But whether it be my love to the Countrey, and deſire of the welfare thereof; or my jealouſie over the Factions of the Rulers, and tumultuouſneſs of the people therein; or my comparing and eſtimating our own ſtrength, fidelity, and courage with our Enemies; or my obſerving, that our former Military Diſcipline (which made us renowned, and our Countrey accounted the School of War) is in a great meaſure, if not ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly decayed and loſt; or my hearing how old Officers, and Forein Forces have been ſlighted; and ſuch preferred, as are unexperienced for conduct, and untried for courage; or the difference I have obſerved in the valour of a poor and rich people; Poverty always ſtirring up and whetting Valour, out of hopes to better their condition; whereas riches makes men fearful of loſing what they have, and ſo falling into a worſe. As may be obſerved not onely in different people, as between the Northern and Southern Nations, but alſo in the ſame, yea in our ſelves. For when poor in our Wars with <hi>Spain,</hi>
               <note place="margin">De Mor. Gern. <hi>§. 29.</hi>

<pb facs="tcp:56430:4"/>all the <hi>German</hi> Nations, or People, the <hi>Batavians,</hi> were cheif for valour; but now that we are grown rich, we are affraid to adventure either our Perſons or Eſtates, and readier to open our Gates, then ſhut them againſt our Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. Or, whether it be my Melancholly temper only; or my fears and cowardiſe, if you pleaſe to call it ſo; or my fancy from my obſervation, that the third War (as this is with <hi>England</hi>) hath ever proved fatal to the one ſide, as is apparent by many examples; or what ever other cauſe it is, I muſt profeſs freely, that I am of another ſentiment, this War having ſo black a viſage to mine appearance, that I fear we are rather in the midſt of a Tempeſtuous Sea of Troubles, then diſcovering of Land, much leſs a ſafe Harbour of reſt.</p>
            <p>I am not ignorant upon how many pins men hang their hopes. Some upon the advancement of his Highneſs the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> hope all will be redreſt and well at home; and that his relation to the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> and the Elector of <hi>Brandenburgh,</hi> will capacitate him to remedy all abroad. Others upon conjectures of his marrying with the Duke of <hi>Yorks</hi> Daughter, or ſome nearly related to the Crown of <hi>England</hi> or <hi>France;</hi> which hath been an uſual way I confeſs, eſpecially among abſolute Princes, of accomoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting differences. Some upon our ſufficient numbers of Men and Moneys to defend our ſelves. Otherſome upon the Aſſiſtance of the <hi>Emperor,</hi> and the <hi>German</hi> Princes, <hi>Brandenburgh</hi> eſpecially. And others upon their opinion, that now the Penſionary <hi>de Wit</hi> and his party are broken, ſo that <hi>England</hi> can confide more in our friendſhip, that the King will break with <hi>France,</hi> and afford his Nephew and theſe <hi>Netherlands</hi> aſſiſtance; eſpecially becauſe they judge, that it is the Intereſt of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Germany,</hi> as well as <hi>Spain,</hi> not to ſee us fall into the <hi>French</hi> hands, for fear they have only <hi>Polyphemus</hi> his courteſie, to be laſt devoured. But yet all theſe grouds, and divers others, which are variouſly diſcourſed of, prevail not ſo far with me, as that my hopes can ballance my fears.</p>
            <p>For although I grant the ſtrength of the remaining Provinces to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable both by Sea and Land; and the greateſt foundation to build our hopes upon, next under God Almighties Protection; yet if we duly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the ſtate and condition we are in, there is not that juſt ground of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence, which may free us from fears; as many are apt to imagine. He is very ſhort ſighted that obſerves not,

                  <item>2. That we might do much more then we do, or (for any thing I yet ſee) will or ſhall do for our own defence.</item>
                  <item>3. That we are deſtitute of ſuccours from abroad for the preſent, except from <hi>Spain;</hi> which we may happily pay dear enough for; if we ſhould be drawn into a League Offenſive and Defenſive with them in a long and te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious War. And</item>

For if they ſee that his Highneſs cannot make Peace, as they expected; and they feel more miſerable effects of a ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born and cruel War, and be forced to greater Taxes (the Common People being always covetous, what ever the cauſe or neceſſity be) and find their Trade ſtill obſtructed, and Land drowned, to the impoveriſhing both of Cities and Countrey; I fear we ſhall find the People ſo reſtleſs and unquiet, that they will neither know what to do themſelves, nor be willing to be guided by their Governors that do; but when Extremities preſs upon us, bring all into Confuſion, and conſequently Ruine.</item>

<pb facs="tcp:56430:5"/>multitude, (which are alwaies enemies to good order and Government) when diſtreſſed; will ſeek occaſion to prey upon the richer, whom they conſtantly envie. And the midle ſort, which are the true Baſis of a State, whoſe principal aime is Liberty and Plenty, when they ſee theſe indanger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; grow jealous of their Governours (upon whom all misfortunes are conſtantly laid) and ſeeke to pull them downe and ſet up themſeves one after another, to the ruine of all. For the pompe of Government ſo daſles the eyes of thoſe that know not the Weight of it, that when there is any ſeeming acceſs thereto, all are apt to contend for it, and every one to thinke himſelf as capable as his neighbor, and vy with one another with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out end: till they that were formerly good paſſengers, now turning Pilots in a Storm; through their continuall contentions and unskilfulneſs, ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrack the Common-wealth, whilſt they ſincerely deſire and endeavour to ſave it. I ſhall therefore conclude, that although we have a good <hi>Head,</hi> yet except the members be at unity, and unanimouſly reſolved to give aſſiſtance to their Head and Governours; it is in vaine to thinke, we can be ſecured from ſuch potent enemies, (except any be ſo mad as to expect miracles) or that the Princes name or waying of his Flag upon our Towers can defend us.</p>
            <p>For his marrying his Highneſs the <hi>Duke of Yorks</hi> Daughter, we may ſpeak of it here, and thoſe in <hi>England</hi> of the King of <hi>Sweden,</hi> and both be mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken. I can ſee little certainty thereof, and therefore can ſay leſs therein; but this I can ſay, that if a Relation would effect our deſires, there is that which is very near already; yea which many perhaps will thinke too neer, if it conduce no more to the procuring our Peace.</p>
            <p>For our aſſiſtance from the <hi>Emperor</hi> and <hi>Germain Princes,</hi> which is ſo much talkt of, the <hi>Brandenburgs</hi> eſpecially; if I were aſſured they deſigned to ſerve us, and not themſelves of us; I ſhould have more hopes then I have. I know the <hi>Germains</hi> are a great and warlike Nation, and that none almoſt have warred with them, that have not repented it. And when we ſee them warr with <hi>France,</hi> though they directly aſſiſt us not further, ſuch a diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to our enemie will be a conſiderable advantage to us. But at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, we ſee no more of their intentions, than to defend themſelves. The <hi>Emperor</hi> is not onely continually kept waking by the <hi>Turk;</hi> but at preſent diverted alſo by the diſtractions of <hi>Hungary.</hi> And the fears of <hi>Poland,</hi> will neceſſitate <hi>Brandenburg</hi> to have an eye to <hi>Pruſſia.</hi> The Princes of the Empire are many, and divided, (ſeveral of them declaring for <hi>France,</hi> others wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering and waiting opportunity to cloſe with the prevailing ſide) which makes their Counſels ſlow, and more ſubject to be diſcovered, the raiſing men and bringing them together more difficult, the commanding of them more lyable to diſcord (which hath often proved fatal in their Armies) and the providing for them very uncertaine. And I might ad hereunto (for it is well knowne) that ſome of the <hi>Germain</hi> Princes have ſo run out their revenues; that though they have men far more then their proportion, yet have not money to pay the half of their rate. So that it is well, if
<pb facs="tcp:56430:5"/>what was ſaid of old of the <hi>Britains,</hi> prove not true of the <hi>Germans,</hi>

            <p>As for the Intereſt of <hi>England,</hi> which we think ſhould incline them to hinder rather than further <hi>Frances</hi> growing greatneſs, and conſequently to Peace with us: I ſhall only ſay this, That as we allow all men liberty to judge of their own Intereſts, ſo muſt we much more to Kings and Rulers. And it is but reaſonable to think, that they underſtand their own Intereſt better then we, that are ſtrangers to their deſigns; except we think of our ſelves as the <hi>Perſians,</hi> who ſay that they have two eyes, and others but one. I may think, that the ſame Reaſon of State ſhould prevail now, that did formerly with the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> in the firſt War, <hi>To humble us, but not ruine us;</hi> and ſhall make it apparent, that they cannot rationally have a thought of our ruine, without thinking to follow after, yet circumſtances are ſo different, and the paſſions of men ſo various, that I am not certain to what extent and degree of Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation they meaſure their Intereſt, or how far <hi>England</hi> is ingaged with <hi>France</hi> for effecting of this. We may think, and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation may be jealous (as I know they are) that <hi>France</hi> will couzen them at laſt, and ſerve them now as <hi>Comines</hi> tells us they have formerly,<note place="margin">l. <hi>3.</hi> c. <hi>8.</hi> &amp; l. <hi>4.</hi> c. <hi>9.</hi> Bodin de Rep. l. <hi>5.</hi> c. <hi>1.</hi>

               <hi>When uſually they beat the French in their Wars; but then what they had got by their Swords, they loſt by their Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,</hi> (even as <hi>Bodin</hi> tells us the <hi>French</hi> were ſerv'd by the <hi>Spaniards;</hi>) but if they will adventure that, who can hinder them?</p>
            <p>Should I ſpeak my private apprehenſion, 'tis briefly this, <hi>England</hi> hath been long jealous of the growing greatneſs of this State by Sea, and find it an error of Policy in former Governors, to ſuffer us to arrive at this height of conteſting with them. From whence they have met with ſeveral inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences in regard of Trade, and alſo been put to vaſt expences to maintain conſtantly a Fleet to cope with us. Theſe things they would willingly eaſe themſelves of, which they know cannot be done, but by the Sword. The firſt War which was occaſionally begun, was no time to effect their deſigns, in regard the Kingdom was harraſt and exhauſted by a long Civil War, and <hi>Oliver</hi> the Protectors cheif deſign was to ſettle himſelf, and therefore made Peace. The ſecond War advantaged them nothing; for the <hi>French</hi> countenancing us (though ſecretly in League with them before the War was ended) they were not able to effect what they deſigned, having loſt their opportunity which they had after the firſt battel in their hands: That being often verified of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> which was ſaid of <hi>Hannibal,</hi> (by whom matters not, for the Learned Hiſtorians <hi>Livie</hi> and <hi>Plutarch</hi> differ therein,) <hi>Vincere ſcis Hannibal; victoria uti neſcis.</hi> A Peace is concluded at <hi>Breda,</hi> but the War had a ſting in the tale of it, the work at <hi>Chattam, Ma<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>et alta mente repoſtum,</hi> and makes them more eagerly wait for an opportunity, both to revenge themſelves, and purſue their former deſigns. And now <hi>France</hi> taking occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to quarrel with us, they take the opportunity to oppreſs us, and bring us under; that they may free themſelves from thoſe preſent inconveniences in Trade and Expences, and will ſee how they can make it with <hi>France</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:56430:6"/>for the future. They know well, that if we be broken, there is no Nation elſe is able to match them at Sea, and being in an Iland, fear not invaſion by Land Forces. I might parallel this with the <hi>Peloponneſian</hi> War, the cauſe whereof was the <hi>Athenians</hi> growing greatneſs, and particularly in Power at Sea;<note place="margin">Lib. <hi>1.</hi>
               </note> upon whom therefore, the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> made War, as <hi>Thucydides</hi> tells us, who hath accurately writ the Hiſtory thereof. And yet though Intereſt be the moving cauſe of moſt Wars,<note place="margin">Hiſt. lib. <hi>3.</hi> c. <hi>6.</hi>

            <list>
               <item>1. That in their League with <hi>France</hi> they have made proviſion for theſe; ſo that if the <hi>French</hi> prevail, they ſhall have ſuch Maritime places, as may be a real ſecurity to them in theſe particulars.</item>
               <item>2. That they will never ſuffer <hi>France</hi> (if they can poſſibly hinder it) to have all theſe Maritime Provinces entirely. For if our might alone be ſuch an eye-ſore to them, how much more if it ſhould be joyned with that of <hi>France.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>3. That they will not deſiſt, till they have tried their utmoſt, to obtain theſe ends which they account their Intereſt; having now the advantage of Alliance with <hi>France,</hi> their joynt Power and Prevalency, and our preſent Weakneſs and Diſtractions. So that I cannot flatter my ſelf ſo much as to hope, That either the Princes Relation to His Majeſty can procure, or Money purchaſe our Peace with them, ſo long as they ſee any probability of effecting their deſigns.</item>

            <p>But if any hath more certain grounds of hope, which are not yet diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered to the World, he needs not loſe his time in peruſing this Treatiſe. It is but my loſing a few ſpare hours in compoſing, and the Printer a ſmall ſum in publiſhing this amongſt thoſe many Pamphlets, which daily flie abroad, through all corners of the Countrey.

               <p>HE is a Stranger to us and our Affairs, who knows not; that the late Revolutions among us, and particularly at <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>trechts</hi> betaking them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the <hi>French</hi> for protection, were attended both with great conſternation, and various deliberations, as is uſual in ſuch diſaſters. When therefore miſery and deſtruction was approaching as a violent torrent, that bears down all before it; Self-preſervation being the Fundamental Law of Nature; every Province, City, and almoſt Village, began to conſider, what they ſhould do to preſerve themſelves, from being drowned in the overflow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deluge.</p>
               <p>Some were of opinion, that the remaining Provinces were of ſufficient ſtrength to defend themſelves, and therefore lookt no further. Others were of a contrary judgment; and therefore thought it better, upon rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable terms, to put our ſelves under a Forein Power, as <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>trecht</hi> had done, then to be conquered by the Sword. And herein alſo mens judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments were divided, ſome thinking it better to be under the <hi>French,</hi> others to be under the <hi>Engliſh.</hi> Thoſe of <hi>Holland</hi> (as was commonly reported) were more inclinable to the former, in regard of their near approach to them in <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>trecht;</hi> and eſpecially out of an opinion which many have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained, That the Intereſt of <hi>Holland,</hi> being principally that of Trade by Sea, was more competible with that of <hi>France</hi> then <hi>England,</hi> Inſomuch, that many believe, if the advice of Monſieur <hi>Pompone</hi> of the Kings ſending <hi>Charte Blanche</hi> had been followed; the Cities of <hi>Holland</hi> had at that time ſeveral of them imitated the example of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>trecht;</hi> thoſe of <hi>Zealand</hi> were generally inclined to the <hi>Engliſh.</hi> But as opinions are uſually both bred and brought up by Paſſions; ſo here it was manifeſt, That the exceſſive hopes of the former, made them for abſolute defence; and the exceſſive fears of the latter, for abſolute reſignation. In ſuch caſes there are two ways have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways been found ſafeſt and beſt for accommodation, <hi>viz.</hi> A due examination of the Grounds of thoſe Paſſions, and a juſt temperament or comprehenſion of the diverſity of Opinions: Which here ſo happily fell out, that it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved upon and declared by many in <hi>Zeeland,</hi> firſt, <hi>That they would uſe their beſt endeavors to defend themſelves;</hi> and ſecondly, <hi>if they found themſelves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, they Would then reſign to the Engliſh.</hi> Hereby ſhewing, that they neither did through vain fears, wholly deſpond of their own ſtrength; nor through flattering hopes were wholly fearleſs of their Enemies. They would try and uſe the beſt means they could, to ſtand of themſelves according to their hopes; and yet alſo provide againſt the worſt of their fears, which was their fall by abſolute conqueſt.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:56430:7"/>
               <p>For the manner of doing this, I ſhall neither accuſe, nor defend it; though the Magiſtrate led not the Van of Conſent, according to his place and dignity,<note place="margin">Plut. l. de fort.</note> yet he followed cloſe in the Rear. And though it was done haſtily, yet why may not a haſty Pen, ſometimes be as happy as <hi>Apelles</hi> his Pencil, which in Paſſion being thrown on the Picture, better portrayed the Horſes foaming, then all his premeditated Counſel and Art.</p>
               <p>It is enough to me, and to my purpoſe, that what was done is agreeable to the true Intereſt of the Countrey; which I hope to make apparent in the following Diſcourſe. But before I do that, give me leave to premiſe a few things, which tend to the clearing of the Matters in queſtion.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. That we only ſuppoſe this inability for the preſent, to ſatisfie the curioſity of the World, which never think their <hi>teliſcope</hi> long enough, to ſee to the utmoſt end of Intereſt. For we ſhall afterwards make it apparent, that we neither are as yet come to that extremity (through Gods mercy) nor need to fear we ſhall be reduced to it, if we be not awanting to our ſelves.</item>
                  <item>2. It is above all to be underſtood, that this reſolution is abſolute for Self-defence, and conditional only for Reſignation. It is an approved maxim which every wiſe man lives by, <hi>Alterius ne ſis, ſi tuus eſſe poſſis,</hi> which holds good in Societies, whether leſſer of Families, or greater of Cities, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces, as well as private perſons. If any can be free, it is folly to think, they will be ſubject to another.</item>
                  <item>3. This reſolution being conditional, upon the ſuppoſal of evident inability to defend our ſelves, it is not to be imagined, that it ſhould take place upon every Danger or Alarm of War, eſpecially ſo long as <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Freeſland</hi> are able to defend themſelves: States as well as Perſons, may be dangerouſly ſick, and yet recover. Differences may be accommodated with our Enemies, or aſſiſtance may be afforded us from our Friends; the Scene of War may change, the Water and Weather may be our Walls of Defence, Difficulties, Diſſentions, and Diſtractions, may befal our Enemies: One thing or other may fall out ſo far to our advantage, that we may retrench our ſelves in ſafety, though we ſhould not recover our former Greatneſs.</item>
                  <item>4. Nor can it reaſonably be thought, that any will give themſelves over to another, ſo as to part with their Religious and Civil Intereſts, and be in no better a capacity then a conquered people; who though they are not made abſolute ſlaves, yet are uſually ſore oppreſt by the Conqueror. But onely to part with their <hi>Supremacy,</hi> and the Appendixes thereunto, under which they may live as free Proteſtant Subjects.</item>

                     <item>2. This ſuppoſes that they have divided the Lions Skin before he be ſlain, which to me is very doubtful. For although two ſuch mighty Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentates, might upon rational grounds, think themſelves able to maſter this Commonwealth, before they began the War; yet ſo many are the
<pb facs="tcp:56430:7"/>unexpected accidents, and the events of War ſo doubtfull, that few have bene knowne to divide the ſpoile, before they had won the battell, or the Country before they had triumphed in the War: leſt they being fruſtrated of their hoped ſucces, ſhould becom a ſcorne and contempt to the world. We have ſufficient reaſon to thinke, that neither <hi>England</hi> will permit <hi>France,</hi> nor <hi>France England,</hi> to have theſe Countries entirely; and can we then thinke that they ſhould agree upon this before hand? if others will ghues, I have the ſame liberty; whereby I thinke that when time (which is the revealer of ſecrets) brings the Treaty to light; it will appeare that the <hi>French</hi> ſhould hold us in by Land, and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> by Sea, till they had brought us to their owne termes; of <hi>France</hi> keeping ſuch places above as may be thought moſt conducible, to the inlarging his Conqueſts and keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us under, and <hi>England</hi> by Sea, as may ſecure his deſired Trade, and Navall expences; and that neither of them ſhould have theſe Maritime Provinces entirely (for that was for the one to make the other his Maſter, and abſolute Soveraigne at Sea, by ſuch an acceſſion of ſtrength) nor yet divided; for that would be a continuall bone of contention betwixt them.</item>
                     <item>3. Thoſe that ſuppoſe this repertition, generally ſay, that <hi>Zeeland</hi> is to be <hi>Engliſh;</hi> and if ſo, the objection is anſwered. For if each muſt conquer their part by their owne Armes, as many imagine; who can thinke that any will be at the expence of ſo much blood and treaſure, beſides the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard of ſucces, for that which they can have upon honourable termes?</item>

               </p>
               <p>Or if they proceed joyntly with their Armes, to obtaine their deſignes; we cannot thinke the one will obſtruct the other, in that which is agreed upon by them both. And this way I ſuppoſe they take; becauſe in a joynt War the ſucces is common to both, and the advantage redounds to each according to their former accord; and was it otherwiſe here, <hi>England</hi> attacquing us onely by Sea, might get nothing by Land, and <hi>France</hi> all.

               <p>HAving now truly related Matter of Fact, and clearly ſtated the Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, I ſhall proceed to prove the ſame, <hi>viz. That in caſe of inability to defend our ſelves, it is our Intereſt to be under the Engliſh rather than the French.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt in regard of Religion. Which as it is of cheifeſt concernment, ſo deſerves to have the precedence of all other conſiderations. The very Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens accounted this their cheif Intereſt, and therefore above all to be ſecured and defended. The <hi>Romans</hi> ſaying was <hi>Pro aris &amp; focis,</hi> therein giving Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the preference of all their civil concernments. And if we Chriſtians do not, the more is our ſin, and the greater our ſhame. It is ſo well known how the Heathens of old, and Turks of later times have valued their ſeveral falſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligions; how their firſt Founders, Legiſlators, and Magiſtrates have made Religion, both the Baſis upon which they founded their Kingdoms and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealths, and the cheif Pillars to ſupport them; and how zealous the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon people have been for their Superſtitions: That I cannot but wonder that <hi>Chriſtians</hi> ſhould be ſuch <hi>Gallices</hi> for the true Religion and Goſpel of Chriſt, and fear that <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Heathens</hi> will riſe up in judgment againſt us, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn us for our indifferency herein. But if examples would either ſway us, or ſhame us, I need not go ſo far for them, our own Anceſtors are abundantly ſufficient. I am ſure (if the Hiſtory of former times deceive me not) Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion was the cheif inducement to them, to begin that hazardous War with <hi>Spain.</hi> And had ſuch an impreſſion upon them, that they freely ventured their lives and eſtates for this eſpecially; although I know there were many other grievances inſiſted on, to juſtifie that War. Had they thought that their Poſterity ſhould have made ſo light of Religion and Liberty, which coſt them ſo dear (as many we ſee in thoſe places over, who have ſo lightly parted with both in a great meaſure,) I perſwade my ſelf they would never have commenced ſuch a War; but the ſincerer part of them would have fled with their Families abroad, rather then have endured thoſe miſeries at home. Could they now ſtand up out of their Graves, how would they condemn this unfaithful generation! And how will our Children have occaſion to curſe us, for betraying the truſt repoſed in us by our Anceſtors,
<pb facs="tcp:56430:8"/>and ſelling the pretious Truths of Religion at ſo cheape a rate, which they bought ſo deare.</p>
               <p>If the true Religion which we profes, be not the Polar Star, by which thoſe that ſit at the Helme ſteere the Ship of the Common-wealth; what can we expect, except we be Atheiſts, and ſhut out God and his ſafeguard, but to ſuffer ſhip-wrack? Nay if this be not the Pearle of price to us all, which we prefer above all worldly pebles, it will be no wonder, if our enimies ſpoile us both of this and them.

                     <item>2. That which rightly teaches every one their duty, not onely in reference to their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular practiſe, but publique concerns, Magiſtrates how to governe, and people how to obey.</item>

                     <item>4. That which onely can aſſure a people of Gods favour and being propitious to them; and the contempt thereof on the contrary, of his diſpleaſure and malediction; We muſt needs conclude, that the Magiſtrate in the firſt place as Gods Vice-gerent in Governement, and all others in their ſeverall Stations, ought to endeavour above all things by all lawfull means to preſerve, defend, and ſecure the ſame; as they tender the honour of God, the welfare of his Church, the proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Commonwealth, and their own and Poſterities temporall and eternall happines. I ſhall not need to enlarge theſe things, in regard they are ſo well knowne, and approvedly verified by ſo many examples, out of Sacred and profane Hiſtories: and none that I know have ever had the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudence to deny them in <hi>Theſi,</hi> though they diſpute in <hi>Hypotheſi</hi> which is the true Religion.

               <p>And for fuller conviction let me ad, that tis not onely an acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged truth, but that which all ages of the Word have experienced, <hi>that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion is the greateſt bond and tye of humane ſociety,</hi> and therefore muſt needs be the maine pillar of ſupport to a State, and the beſt walls of defence to a people. Hoping therefore what is ſaid in the generall to be ſufficient, I ſhall now deſcend to particulars briefly.</p>
               <p>And herein it is well known, that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and we (I ſpeak of the generality of both Nations, Rulers and people) ſymboliſe; being both of the Reformed Religion. Whereas the <hi>French</hi> are for the greateſt part Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts, to be ſure all in power whether civill or military: it being the practiſe now of <hi>France,</hi> to imploy none but ſuch in the management of affaires; ſo that if we be either Governed or Garriſoned by the <hi>French,</hi> we cannot exſpect to be ſo by any, but Papiſts and profeſſed enemies of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</p>
               <p>But ſomething here will be pleaded for the <hi>French,</hi> and ſomething allſo objected againſt the <hi>Engliſh.</hi>
               </p>

                  <hi>Sect. 3.</hi> The plea of France's granting us the liberty of our Religion conſidered.</head>
               <p>FIrſt for the <hi>French</hi> it may be argued, that the King will grant us the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of our Religion.</p>
               <p>To which I reply by way of conceſſion, that I verily believe he will; but deſire it may be further conſidered.</p>
               <p n="1">1. If he grants this liberty according to the cuſtome of <hi>France,</hi> it will be onely to thoſe of the reformed Religion. Now beſides theſe, there are many others amongſt us, Iews, Lutherans, Anabaptiſts, &amp;c. The common-wealth conſiſting both of ſeveral ſorts of people, and ſeverall ſorts of Religions: and what ſhall become of thoſe, which the common-wealth tollerates, though not of the profeſſed Religion of the Land?</p>
               <p n="2">2. But let it be further ſuppoſed, that proviſion be made for the liberty of thoſe allſo that diſſent from the reformed Religion, or for all, and that by Articles, Edicts, or whatſoever way you pleaſe: yet we know how ſlightly theſe are uſually obſerved, by thoſe that have the execution of them, and how litle Governors and Soldjers regard theſe. For they well know, that moſt cannot, many dare not, others will not complaine of them; and if any doe, it will be a weariſome worke, and the remedy many times worſe than the diſeaſe. So that a patient ſuffering is the onely ſolace to the ſufferer and oppreſſed.</p>
               <p n="3">3. I might add, that it is a maxim with many Papiſts (allthough not all I confes<note n="*" place="margin">Molanus de fide hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticis ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanda.</note>) <hi>that no faith is to be kept with hereticks.</hi> Now all Papiſts accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting us ſuch, if thoſe that Governe be of that perſwaſion; how litle ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count will they make of what conditions ſoever are made with us; but as
<pb facs="tcp:56430:9"/>occaſion ſerves, if they dare not openly breake, yet will they ſecretly evade, all ſuch as ſerve for our ſupport, and thinke they doe God good ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. As allſo their tenet of the Popes power of diſpenſation with all oaths, Articles, Promiſes and obligations though never ſo ſolemn and ſacred: or if you pleaſe (for it is all one) a power to abrogate Gods laws, nul all the faith and bonds of man-kind, ſubvert all humaine Society, and in ſhort <hi>ex injuſtitia facere Juſtitiam</hi> as the <hi>Canoniſts</hi> tell us.<note place="margin">De tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlat. Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cop. c. quanto in gloſſa.</note> Now ſuppoſe we have Governors that meaſures conſciences by ells rather than inches; who matters no more engagements diſpenſed with by his <hi>Holines,</hi> than we doe our Almanacks out of date. I ſhould be glad to be informed what we could doe in the caſe, more then cry and complaine to God Allmighty. For I doubt they will ſeldome doe that, which <hi>Maximilian</hi> the firſt did fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, <hi>Deus aeterne, niſi vigilares, quàm malè eſſe mundo,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Morn. Myſter. Iniquit,</note> 
                  <hi>quem regimus nos ego miſer venator, &amp; ebrioſus illè ac ſceleratus Julius!</hi> Nay if Governors thinke themſelves obliged in conſcience and honour to keepe conditions; yet it is well known how generally they are influenced by their Clergy: ſo that in all dubious caſes, and the application of generall rules to particular practiſes, it cannot be exſpected but judgement ſhould be given on the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts ſide, and that the Grandees of the Church ſhould beare them out in it, and <hi>Jeſuits</hi> and others Zelots applaude their practiſes.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The Papiſts muſt have publique places for their Worſhip, not only in all Cities but Villages, as we may ſee in the Articles propounded by the <hi>French.</hi> Now there being by far too few <hi>Churches</hi> or places for publique Worſhip, in moſt of our populous and enlarged Cities allready; it will not be poſſible for a great part of our Religion, to enjoy the publique Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances of God; but many will run into profane courſes, moſt grow ignorant and careles what Religion they are of, and their poſterity abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute <hi>Papiſts.</hi> By which meanes the number of the Reformed decreaſing, and Papiſts increaſing; where at firſt there was but onely one <hi>Church</hi> for po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery; they ſhall then take more, and ſo continue to inlarge themſelves and ſtraten us. Nor let any judge theſe, as onely jealouſies and feares. For if they begin allready to incroach (as it is credibly reported from ſeverall places they command) and breake Articles heerein, when not onely the commands of ſuperiors, but common policy requires a moſt religious obſervance thereof; what ſhall we thinke they will doe hereafter? If they will not now out of hopes to win thoſe to them, which yet ſtand out: much les will they, when there is no more hope of gaining thereby.</p>
               <p n="5">5. When popery is the Religion of our Governors, who have the diſpoſall of preferments and profits, to allure men to their Religion: We ſhall find by wofull experience, what by education, converſe, marriages, dignities and other worthy advantages; many of the ignoranter and looſer ſort of Proteſtants, will change their profeſſion (I ſay not Religion for that ſuch never had) and turne Papiſts. Who is ſuch a ſtranger in the world as knowes not, that by ſuch artifices they have more weakened the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants
<pb facs="tcp:56430:10"/>in <hi>France,</hi> than by all their wars and conteſts with them. In ſo much that of late yeares, ſome wiſe men of the Reformed Religion there, have bene ſo fear full of its being utterly ſupplanted; that they have required their children by their laſt will and Teſtament, to leave that Kingdome, and ſetle themſelves in theſe Countries.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Let the beſt he ſuppoſed that any rationall man can imagine, yet will it be bad enough. For if the Papiſts have the Civill power to back them, allthough the wiſer and better ſort, it is not to be doubted will be civill; yet the the ruder ſort will be intollerably inſolent. And this begins to appear in ſome places allready, where the Popiſh Inhabitants are more inſufferably inſulting, ſpightfull, and injurious than the <hi>French</hi> themſelves. And if they doe this ſo early while things are doubifull, and the iſſue of the War dubious; what may we expect when they are in their high Meridian of ſucces and glory?</p>
               <p n="7">7. And laſtly, if any one thinkes that theſe are onely needles feares and groundles ſurmiſes, I ſhall deſire them to peruſe the <hi>French</hi> Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors Speech to the Emperors Council,<note place="margin">Gremon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville.</note> where he will find this Argument of Religion inſiſted on to divert the Emperor from our aſſiſtance (which is well retorted by the ingenious Anſwerer thereof.) And inform themſelves how faſt the Jeſuits and other Zealots for the Romiſh Religion, fall off from the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria</hi> and <hi>Spaint</hi> to <hi>France;</hi> in regard of their ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility to carry on their deſigns of the Univerſall Popiſh Monarchy, and the hopes they have of <hi>France</hi>'s potency to effect it. And then let them judge, if there be not ſufficient ground, for all that I have ſaid, and much more that might be ſaid upon this Subject.</p>

               </p>
               <p n="1">1. That the King is a Papiſt in heart, and deſignes to ſet up the Popiſh Religion.</p>
               <p>Firſt what the King is in his heart, and what he deſignes, is onely knowne to God Almighty, who is the ſearcher of hearts. That he is a profeſt proteſtant, is well knowne. And allthough I will not ſweare for him nor any man alive, that he will not change his Religion; yet to me it ſeems very improbable, upon the following grounds.</p>
               <p n="1">1. He that would not in his minority, when under his Mothers educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in <hi>France,</hi>

               <pb facs="tcp:56430:10"/>
               <p n="2">2. His withſtanding ſo many temptations wherewith he was environed ſo long a time together, during thoſe many years of his exile; wherein neither the friendſhip of Papiſts, nor unkindneſs and hard meaſure he met withal from Proteſtants could move him;<note place="margin">Militi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ere's Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory of the Truth, and Bp.

What Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſions and Arguments they uſed both by word and writing? What Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes they made him of aſſiſtance to recover his Kingdoms? What Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments of Intereſt they preſt him with, which are uſually more prevalent with Princes, than the intrinſick Arguments of Religion? And if he ſtood unſhaken in all thoſe boyſterous blaſts, ſhall we thinke he will fall in a calme?</p>
               <p n="3">3. His reſcuing his youngeſt Brother the <hi>Duke of Gloceſter</hi> out of his Mothers hands, when her deſignes appeared for perverting him in his Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; is an evident proofe of the realty of his Profeſſion. If any one ſay it was his Intereſt for regaining his Kingdoms. I ſay.</p>
               <p n="4">4. And is it not his Intereſt alſo for keeping them? Did he gaine them ſo quickly, or are his three Kingdoms ſo little worth, that he ſhould eaſily hazard them? Kings are wiſer then to venture their Crownes upon every idle Prieſts pratles. If there were any ſtronger Arguments now then formerly, either for the Popiſh Religion, or from his Intereſt; we had ſome reaſon to be jealous that he might change.</p>
               <p>But 5. It is apparently againſt his Intereſt, not onely in regard of the danger he might incur of loſing his Crownes, but the great loſs which would inevitably accrew to him by this change.</p>
               <p>The danger we cannot imagine to be ſmall, if we rightly conſider thoſe Kingdoms. I have had an accompt (having been a little curious in thoſe enquiries) of 1100000 of his Subjects, that by Intereſt and Inclination were carried counter to the Court. Under theſe five Heads.

It is true he hath the executive power of the lawes, and ſo can ſuſpend the execution of penalties; but cannot reſcind any one law, much leſſe make new ones, without the conſent of Parliament in his reſpective Kingdomes. And abſolute Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raingty is not there in uſe. For power paramount to all lawes, carries too great a top-ſaile for an <hi>Engliſh</hi> bottom; wherein the Subjects liberties are ſhipt, as well as <hi>Coeſar and his fortunes.</hi>

                  <item>2. The lands and revenues formerly ſupporting the Romiſh Religion, which are many and great, are in the poſſeſſion of the nobility and gentry for the moſt part; and have beene bought by them of the Crowne at the
<pb facs="tcp:56430:11"/>diſſolution of Abbies, Monaſteries, &amp;c. And the purchaſes confirmed by law. And can we thinke that they will be ever induced to part with them againe? or enact any ſuch lawes as ſhall tend to their owne ruine, and the utter undoing of their families? If there was ſo much danger and difficulty to wreſt them out of the hands of the poore Votaries, (as the Hiſtories of thoſe times tell us) What will there be to recover them from the powerfull Nobility and Gentry? who legally poſſeſſing them will doubtleſs defend them, ſo that none ſhall deprive them thereof, that have not better courage and ſharper Swords then they.</item>
                  <item>3. The great diſparity in the number of Proteſtants and Papiſts. There being not one family of a hundred in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland</hi> Popiſh, and in many and great Pariſhes not a Papiſt. Now what greater madneſs can we imagine, than that his Majeſty ſhould adventure to rely upon the Papiſts alone, againſt all the Proteſtants of the three Nations. Though their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers are greater then formerly, yet are they comparatively ſmall (as we have ſaid) to thoſe that profes the Reformed Religion. So that it can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver enter into my braine, that ſuch folly ſhould enter into any Princes breſt, much les one who hath ſuffered ſo much, by the former diviſions of his Kingdoms.</item>
                  <item>4. The vaſt difference between a people enlightned by the Goſpel, and well grounded in their Religion, and an ignorant and unprincipled people. For the generality of the common people brought up in ignorance, (as they uſually are under Popery) are more ſubject to receive impreſſions from their Teachers, and ſo by degrees change their Profeſſion. Whereas thoſe who are aſſured from the Word of God, that they are in the right; will by no means be induced to the ſame. And uſually the more force is uſed, the more obſtinate they are. For a ſetled Conſcience deſpiſes dain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and defies all the terrors and torments, that their cruelleſt adverſaries can invent. If in leſſer differences of Church-government, the King hath found it ſo difficult, that after all the coercive Lawes, and other meanes he hath uſed, he tells the world, <hi>'tis evident by the ſad experience of twelve yeares, that there is very little fruit of all thoſe forceable courſes;</hi>

Surely not much from the Pious and ſober party of Proteſtants; for I neither matter nor mention the ruder ſort, and ignorant rable. Nay univerſall experience hath taught the World, that where any kind of Religion is powerfull, all force againſt it is weake and contemptible: and much more againſt the true Reformed Religion; as that wiſe and excellent Hiſtorian <hi>Thuanus</hi> ſhewes in the Preface to his Hiſtory,<note place="margin">The other two are <hi>Calv.</hi> to his Inſtit. &amp; <hi>Cauſa<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

Therefore that Papiſts increaſe, through the Queens Court, the extraordinary correſpondence with <hi>France,</hi> the diſſentions of the Proteſtants, the Atheiſme and irreligion of the Age, and other wayes and meanes which might be mentioned, is not to be wondred at; but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that there are no more. Allthough I am well aſſured, that their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber is comparatively ſmall, and their Intreſt in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland</hi> inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable to effect any change. And were they more, this will not infer the King is one.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And much les his countenancing and intruſting them.

Or the States Papiſts, for employing the <hi>French</hi> and others in their Armies?

               <p>But to come cloſer to the particular caſe. If his Majeſty therefore had no obligation upon him to do this, or were it a liberty to Papiſts only, or a liberty for their worſhip in publick; I ſhould grant the objection was very weighty; but it is the quite contrary. For he tells the world he was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged in point of gratitude to the Papiſts for their ſervice to his Father; and to the Presbyterians (who had been ſo inſtrumentall in his reſtoration) in point of promiſe allſo, ſeverall wayes made to them both before and after his returne to his Crowne; ſeverall times declaring that he would grant in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence to them and others of tender conſciences And we know that if his Majeſty had followed his own inclinations, they had been better performed. And now that he gives a conceſſion of liberty, it is neither ſoly nor principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to thoſe of the Romiſh Religion, but to all others as well as they, and that with this manifeſt difference, that it is to the <hi>Proteſtants publiquely, and to Papiſts in their private houſes onely,</hi> and this revocable at pleaſure.<note place="margin">Declar. <hi>March</hi> 15. 1672.</note> All though ſome wiſe men are of opinion, that the King and Rulers will not onely find ſuch eaſe and ſafety therein; but ſuch eminent advantages ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny wayes, and the people generally ſuch content, that it will ſcarce be revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked.</p>

When a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are neither oppreſſed by uſurpation, without colour of Law; nor by extortion, under pretext thereof. Which is an invaluable mercy to thoſe that injoy it: though rightly valued by few, except thoſe that want it.

               <p>Now Secondly wherein this conſiſts, and how to meaſure the ſame, is harder to diſcover and determine; in regard we can meet with no guides, that have gone this way. For the Civil Law, which is copious concerning all other Dominions, is ſilent in this of <hi>Soveraignty;</hi> and being calculated for the Meridian of <hi>Monarchs,</hi> leaves them free to make their Subjects ſo, more or leſs at their pleaſure: Hiſtorians onely relate what freedom ſuch and ſuch people had under ſuch and ſuch Rulers: and the Writers of Policy, and particular Republicks, compare the peoples liberty under the ſeveral forms of Government, and commend this or that State for the ſame.

<pb facs="tcp:56430:14"/>We will therefore paſs them all by, and freely follow our own judgment; in ſhewing joyntly both the nature of liberty, and the meaſures thereof. But we muſt neceſſarily here premiſe.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. That though all ought to pay the homage of ſubjection, to that law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful government under which they live; yet none ought ſo to be wedded to any forme, as to think the ſubjects of all others not free.

                  <item>2. That the beſt way to judge of peoples liberty is by conſidering it in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to Soveraignty. For all ſubjection and government being relatives; and Subject, liberty conſiſting, in ſuch a manner of ſubjection to the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Powers, as is free and not ſlaviſh; the one is eaſily knowne by the other. So that if we duly conſider Supremacy, we may diſcerne, whether the Subjects be free or no by the manner, and the degrees of their freedom, by the meaſure of their ſubjection.</item>
                  <item>3. That we muſt diſtinguiſh between <hi>actual liberty.</hi> or freedom from op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion; and <hi>legal liberty</hi> by conſtitution. For freedom may be conſidered either in regard of morall power, or government which is the exerciſe thereof; and that both ſeverally, and joyntly. For a people free by Law, may be oppreſſed by their Rulers; and a people not legally free, may be actually ſo by their Governors grace. So that actuall liberty alone, is onely under abſolute Powers, legal under limited and mixed, and both under Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments which proceed regularly, in the Sphere of Power wherein they are placed, and are not planetary in their motions. Having premiſed theſe things; we ſhall now proceed to lay down certain rules, whereby every vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar capacity may judge, of the nature of liberty and the degrees thereof, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der any kind of Soveraignty whatſoever. Whether it reſide in a ſingle per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, or in a plurality; either abſolute, or limited in regard of its meaſure; or for the manner ſimple or mixed; either of two or three eſtates, equally or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equally, and from whatever priority or predominant part denominated, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy, Ariſtocracy, or Democracy, according to the conſtitution of every Nation.</item>

               <p>And the general rule is this. <hi>The greater power in the Soveraignty, the leſſer liberty in the Subjects; and the leſs power in the Soveraignty, the more liberty in the Subjects.</hi> It is not my preſent work to determine, whether of theſe is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for the whole. The Polititians pens have ſufficiently ventilated that queſtion; uſually aſcribing more ſtrength and ſtability to the former, and more common proſperity to the latter; though often concluding, either through favour or fear and fl<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ttery, that that Government under which they live, deſerves above all to weare the garland I ſhall therefore onely ſay this, that ſeeing extreames are alwayes dangerous; a golden meane is
<pb facs="tcp:56430:14"/>that, which makes a golden age, both to Soveraigns and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects.</p>
               <p>Now although I judge this rule alone, ſufficient for our preſent purpoſe; yet in regard ſome perhaps, may be pleaſed with ſo large a proſpect, as the liberty of all Nations in all ages of the world; we ſhall take a fuller view thereof; and the rather, becauſe it will be of uſe to us hereafter, not onely in this but the following Sections. And for this end will begin at the bottom, that ſo aſcending by degrees, we may behold both it and them the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
               <p n="1">1. A people under <hi>abſolute power,</hi> are not truly and legally free, but onely permiſſively and precariouſly. Becauſe their liberty is not from Law, but onely founded in their Governors favor. So that they are liable to all oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, although they are ſometimes as actually free, and little oppreſſed, as thoſe that live under other Governments.</p>
               <p>And this liberty, as to the certainty thereof, is more or les according to the degrees of abſolute power. Where the Rulers will, is the peoples Law; freedom is an <hi>Embryo,</hi> rather than formed: when they make Laws, whereby Subjects are at more certainty; it then becomes a <hi>foetus:</hi> and when they oblige themſelves, to rule by thoſe Laws; the <hi>child</hi> is borne, and may cry out of violence and oppreſſion. This <hi>liberty,</hi> how ſmall ſoever, and uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of life, hath yet many witneſſes to avouch its name; which we find alſo regiſtred in Antiquity. So that whoſoever denies the ſame; muſt call all thoſe <hi>ſlaves,</hi> who lived under the Eaſtern and Roman Empires of old, and the Turks and Perſians at this day.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Under <hi>limited power,</hi> the people have a legall liberty, which is greater or les, according to the Laws, conſtitutions, or contracts, whereby the power is limited. Whether originally and antecedently; or by after condeſcent, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt thoſe in Supremacy and them in ſubjection; is not much materiall. This liberty being ſupported by Law, not voluntarily made by the Governors themſelves, and alterable at their pleaſure (as in abſolute power) but neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily condeſcended to by them that will governe, makes the ſubjection of a people tolerable And if the Fathers in power pleaſe to foſter them, they want not for neceſſaries, though they abound not in ſuperfluities. But I confes, if this freedom meet with a churliſh ſtepfather, and hath neither guardian not friends to maintain its right; then its forced to keep private at home, and dare ſcarce appear in publike; which makes their preſent condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion miſerable. For liberty once lamed by power, is not unlike to a labouring man, that hath his leg broken; who till it be ſound, Is thereby confined to his own cottage, or cralls but abroad to beg with his crutches.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Thoſe that live under a <hi>mixed power,</hi> have more or les liberty according to the temperament thereof.</p>
               <p>If mixt of Monarchie and Acriſtocracy onely, the common peoples liberty is according to their Laws. And is more ſecured by this compoſition, than in a ſimple governement, though limited; becauſe one is a check to the
<pb facs="tcp:56430:15"/>exorbitancy of the other. For though every mixt power be limited, yet every limited power is not mixt. In this Government, though the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, ſhould as Cedars ſhelter the underſhrubs, from the ſtorms of the ſuperior order; yet both Hiſtorie and experience ſhews us, that often times (I ſay not allwayes) the Peeres care not to be their Princes Vaſſalls, that ſo the reſt of the people may be theirs.</p>
               <p>If mixed ſo that the common people have a ſhare in the Supreme Power, they are <hi>abſolutely free;</hi> and their liberty is more or les, according as their ſhare is. Whether it be mixed of all the three kinds of Government, <hi>viz.</hi> Monarchie, Ariſtocracy, and Democracy; or onely of the two latter; for I never read or heard of a State compounded of the two extreames.</p>
               <p>Now the Supreme Power conſiſts eſpecially (I ſay not onely)
<list>
                     <item>1. In en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acting, interpreting, and repealing of Laws.</item>
                     <item>2. In electing and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing ſubordinate Magiſtrates and Miniſters of State for Government.</item>
                     <item>3. In judging and determining all crimes and controverſies amongſt their Subjects, ultimately without appeale.</item>
                     <item>4. In leavying of taxes to defray publick expences.</item>
                     <item>5. In the power of Armes for defence of the whole.</item>
                     <item>6. In making War and Peace with others. So then as a people partake in theſe, their freedom is accordingly to be accounted of. And here liberty is come to maturity; and if ſhe be modeſt, and keep within her bounds, and fall not into wanton licentiouſneſs; raviſhes the eyes of all ſpectators, fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling their mouthes with her praiſes, and their mindes with admiration.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>But it is high time that we haſten unto the third particular propoſed, which is the accommodation of theſe, to the ſubject matter we have in hand.</p>
               <p>Firſt then, it is well known, that there is a very vaſt difference in the liberty of the Subjects of theſe two Crowns. The common people under the King of England have 1. A part in the legiſlative power, which is the chief au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority in all Governements. For the Commons make a third State in all the three Kingdoms; and have their repreſentatives freely choſen by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in all Parliaments; which are the true Conſervatories of publique liberty and particular propriety. Whereas the common people in France either never had this priviledge; or if they had, have long ſince loſt it That they had it formerly,<note place="margin">Franco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gallioe. c. <hi>10.11.15.</hi> Derepubl. l. <hi>2.</hi> c. <hi>6. §. 6.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Hottoman</hi> endeavours to prove, which <hi>Arniſoeus</hi> denies, (and anſwers his reaſons,) nor that only, but all mixture in the French Monarchy either with Princes of the Blood, Peers, or any other State whatſoever. But whatever was the Governement, under the two firſt lines of the Kings of France; it is generally agreed, that in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the third under <hi>Hugh Capet,</hi> (who cantond out France about the yeare 990) the peoples liberty was devoured by the Dukes and Earles of the Provinces, and the Monarchie allmoſt turned into a Toparchie, by reaſon of their hereditary right. Which the after Kings ſoone perceiving, to be too great a ballance to the Crowne, broke down by degrees; and ſo became the only <hi>Atlas's</hi> that have ever ſince ſuſtan'd that Government. For the Aſſembly of the three Eſtates, which were the only bulwark of the
<pb facs="tcp:56430:15"/>publick liberty, that was left undemoliſhed by deſpotical powers; if they ever had any ſhare in the legiſlative, loſt it long before <hi>Capets</hi> time, (for from <hi>Charles</hi> the great the Kings Edicts have paſt for Laws.) and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſcontinued in their Wars with <hi>England,</hi> and their remaining power (whatever it was) broke down by the policy of <hi>Lewis</hi> the eleventh; they were finally laid aſide by <hi>Lewis</hi> the laſt. And although <hi>Philip</hi> the fourth fixed that Court of Judicature at <hi>Paris,</hi> that was formerly ambulatory and uſually accompanied the Kings Court, which became a pattern to the reſt of their Provincial Parliaments; yet both that and theſe have only the name and ſhadow; not the nature and power of the Parliaments under the Crown of <hi>England.</hi> The Members being neither choſen by the people, nor repreſenting them; but Lawjers, that uſually either purchaſe theſe places of the Crown, or pay an annual penſion for the ſame; having no legiſlative power, nor indeed any other but derivative from the King, and alterable at his pleaſure. They tell the Academy of <hi>Paris;</hi>

                  <hi>ſe à Rege juſſos promulgare leges, quas ipſi viſum fuerit ferre. Apud illum authoritatem eſſe, &amp;c.</hi> But theſe things are ſo well known, that I will not ſtand to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge Authorities to prove them; although, if it were neceſſary, I could bring as many as would fill the page even to oſtentation. But let us brieſly run over the reſt. Thoſe 2. under the Crown of <hi>England</hi> have the election of Magiſtrates generally in Corporations, and ſome under Officers in the Country, which cannot be removed without due proceſs of Law. 3. Have a ſhare in the Judicature, by the Juries (in <hi>England</hi>) for matter of fact, together with the Kings Judges for matter of Law, and their laſt appeal to Parliaments. 4. The original power of raiſing Taxes. For the propoſal and grant muſt come from the Commons, and the other two States only conſent. 5. The liberty of bearing Arms. Whereas in <hi>France,</hi> all Promotions, Governments, Judicatures and Taxes, are in the Kings power; who permits not the vulgar uſe of Arms, or a ſtanding <hi>Militia</hi> in his Kingdom; but only ſuch as are in his pay, and thereby entirely at his devotion. So that there is no Communalty that lives more happily than that of <hi>England,</hi> nor none more miſerably than the <hi>poor paiſantry</hi> of <hi>France.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Hence we may infer a fair probability, of enjoying more liberty under the Crown of <hi>England</hi> than <hi>France.</hi> I know our freedom will not neceſſarily follow from the premiſes; for that which is <hi>legal,</hi> will depend upon ſuch conditions, as ſhall be either previouſly agreed upon, or after conſented unto: yet I leave every one to judge, which is likelieſt to grant us the beſt; not only for our Religion, but liberty in our Perſons, Priviledges and Eſtates; as alſo whoſe Government is moſt likely to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the ſame, and make us thereby alſo <hi>actually free.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If it be argued, that the <hi>French King</hi> may give us more liberty than his other Subjects; and the <hi>King of England</hi> leſs. The reply is eaſie; that we reaſon not from the power of either, or what they can and may do; but what in all appearance they will do. Although thoſe that hold it for a
<pb facs="tcp:56430:16"/>fundamental in the <hi>French</hi> Government, that whatever is conquered by them or acquired, muſt be incorporated with the Kingdom of <hi>France;</hi> and that this is as indiſpenſable for the body politick, as the <hi>Salick Law</hi> is for the head; ſcruple much, whether the King <hi>de jure,</hi> can make us freer than the reſt of his Subjects. But we neither deſire to diſpute the Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative of Princes, much leſs of ſuch a mighty Monarch; nor indeed are we of their opinion herein, and therefore take it for granted, that he as well as the <hi>King of England,</hi> may grant us as full and ample liberty, as He ſhall think fit in His Royal pleaſure. We only profeſs our fears what he will do, and ſuch as are rational and becoming men; not groundleſs fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, or frivolous reports, which are the uſual <hi>Bugbears,</hi> that affright only fearful women and children.</p>
               <p n="1">1. We cannot flatter our ſelves into hopes, that our condition ſhould be better than either of thoſe two Kings (which ſoever we ſubmit unto) natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Sujects. If it be equal, it is well; and all that we can rationally expect. And therefore we judge, that <hi>England</hi> will eaſier be induced to this, which is ordinary unto that Government; than <hi>France,</hi> to indulge us of extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary favour, unleſs we had merited ſuch a priviledge, as to be made an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception from the general rule. And that Governors under them will wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly and readily maintain, that which they are accuſtomed unto; but very hardly ſuch immunities, as tranſcend the bounds which are ſet to others.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The many examples we have before us, of ſuch Countries as <hi>France</hi> hath gained, keeps our fears continually waking. For by whatever Title they have been acquired, we find them all generally in the ſame condition. Whether by right of donation, as <hi>Daulphiny</hi> and <hi>Provence,</hi> or purchaſe as <hi>Berry Montpelier &amp;c.</hi> or marriage, as <hi>Bourbon, Champagne, Languedock, Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taigny, &amp;c.</hi> or by conqueſt and powerful ſeizure, as <hi>Normandy, Aquitane, Poictou, Anjou,</hi> and whatſoever held on <hi>England</hi> by <hi>Charles</hi> the ſeventh, and <hi>Burgundy</hi> with thoſe that depended thereon, by his ſon <hi>Lewis</hi> the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leventh; all theſe being incorporated with <hi>France,</hi> (what ever their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer immunities were, and whatever leſſer they ſtill injoy) are all equally ſubject to all Laws, Governments, and Impoſitions from the Crown, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out diſpute and contradiction. And can we then be ſuch fools, as to think, that though we come under <hi>France,</hi> yet we ſhall be free? But now on the contrary we know, that whatſoever acceſſion hath been made to the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> either by mariiage as <hi>Scotland,</hi> or conqueſt as <hi>Ireland,</hi> that they have all their Laws, Priviledges, Governments, and Immunities remaining entirely, as inviolable from the Crown, and unalterable with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out their own conſent. Nor do they only injoy theſe, but make Laws for ſupporting them, according to their particular intereſts; yea croſs and oppoſite to the other, which yet are ratified by his Majeſty, or at leaſt by his Royal authority and pleaſure.</p>
               <p n="3">3. If any have neither liſt nor leiſure, to look into the Hiſtories of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer times; the preſent age will furniſh them ſufficiently, with examples
<pb facs="tcp:56430:16"/>both foreign and domeſtick. Let them enquire of <hi>Lorraign</hi> and <hi>Flanders,</hi> how they fare with their new Maſters. Or let them but paſs into the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jacent Provinces, and inform themſelves of the <hi>French</hi> Government; and then they may ſee as in a Glaſs, the face of their own future condition, And if any be reſolvedly blind, that they will not ſee, except they be deaf alſo, or ſtop their ears; they may hear enough, (if the tenth part of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports be but true) to warn them ſufficiently to look to themſelves. But if they remain ſo incredulous, that all the Beacons that are fired about them, makes them not fear; and that they will believe nothing, which they themſelves do not feel: I wiſh that experience (which wiſe men call <hi>the Miſtreſs of Fools</hi>) convince them not of their folly, when it is too late; and their condition become ſo miſerable, that its fitter to be drawn cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with a ſorrowful veil, by ſome <hi>Timanthes</hi>'s Pencil, than to be lively ſet forth in its ſad colours, or deſcribed by the Pen of an impartial Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian. For my part I profeſs that none honours the worth and gallantry of the <hi>French</hi> Nation more than my ſelf, yet I would loth come under its power: for the reaſon which the Fox gives the Lion in the Fable,</p>
               <p>—quia me veſtigia terrent, Omnia te adverſum ſpectantia, nulla retrorſum.</p>
               <note place="margin">Horat. Epiſt. l. <hi>1.</hi> Ep. <hi>1.</hi>
               </note>
               <p n="4">4. We think we have reaſon to be afraid not only for our perſons, and purſes; but even for our lives, and all thoſe things which may make us miſerable; not only in regard of the <hi>French,</hi> but our <hi>ſelves.</hi> For we know that a people accuſtomed to liberty, who have had enough given them and taken much more, when once they come to be reſtrained, and ſtrictly held in by the rains of Government; are very apt to break out into mutinies and miſchiefs; and like wild Colts in their firſt managing, ruſh deſperate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly into ruin, that they may throw their Riders. Yea when <hi>Conquerors</hi> think they have ſo harnaſſed the multitude, that they dare not but draw their triumphant Chariots; and doubt not but they themſelves ſit ſo faſt, that they may drive them out of breath, and ſo tame them at their pleaſure: they uſually <hi>Phaëton</hi> like, ſet all on fire; and if they eſcape the popular fury by running away in the ſmoak, meet with his fate, to be ſtruck wit the Thunderbolt of their Soveraigns juſtice. Innumerable are the examples for the confirmation of this; but we will confine our ſelves to our own Country; and content ourſelves with two only. When <hi>Philip</hi> the fourth had beat the <hi>Flemmings,</hi> united <hi>Flanders</hi> to <hi>France,</hi> and ſet Governours over them; who erected Citadels in their ſeveral Towns, Garriſoned their Citics to keep them in aw,<note place="margin">Serres in Phil. <hi>4.</hi>
                  </note> and arbitrarily charged them with great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributions; the people that were uſed to Freedom, would not be brought into this yoke of bondage; but deſperately revolt, maſſacre the <hi>French,</hi> and involve all in confuſion and miſery. Nor is this all; for, (though the baſer ſort begin, yet great men uſually end ſuch quarrels) a War fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, which coſt both <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Flanders</hi> dear, in the vaſt expence both of blood and treaſure. And when <hi>Duke d' Alva</hi> attempted the like upon our Anceſtors in theſe <hi>Provinces,</hi> who were a free people and not uſed to
<pb facs="tcp:56430:17"/>ſuch ſeverity; how did the ſparks of mutiny in the beginning break out into great flames at laſt, which ſet the whole Country on fire? No pen is able to expreſs the miſeries of thoſe Times; nor Tragedy repreſent the things that were perpetrated. How were moſt mens hearts filled with <hi>fear,</hi> many with <hi>horror,</hi> and ſome with <hi>deſpair;</hi> to ſee their Country be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come an <hi>Aceldama;</hi> and ſo many thouſands forced through <hi>a Red Sea of blood,</hi> to find their paſſage to the Land of <hi>Canaan!</hi> I conclude therefore, that if they who enjoyed leſs liberty than we, could ſo little endure Servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude; we ſhall be much leſs able to endure it, who have enjoyed far more freedom then they. So that we may eaſily foreſee, without any Prophetick Spirit, what a <hi>flood of calamities</hi> is likely to break in upon us; when ever any ſhall break down the <hi>banks of our liberty.</hi>

                  <hi>Sect. 6.</hi> The third Argument which preponderates for <hi>England,</hi> is the preſervation of our Eſtates: in regard of Souldiers vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, Governors Impoſitions, Publick Debts by Obligation, and Revenues of the Romiſh Church.</head>
               <p>WE proceed now to ſhew, that its better to be under <hi>England</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of our <hi>Eſtates.</hi> Both in reſpect of <hi>getting</hi> them, (as I ſhall ſhew in the following Section) and the <hi>keeping</hi> thoſe we have gotten al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, or by the bleſſing of <hi>God</hi> may get hereafter. And to this I give the precedency, becauſe the enjoyment of Riches is the end for which, and Trade only the means by which, we labour to obtain them. Now if it can be made apparent, that we can neither get, nor keep ſuch <hi>Eſtates</hi> under <hi>France,</hi> as we can under <hi>England:</hi> there are none ſo regardleſs herein (what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they are of <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Liberty</hi>) but will eaſily grant the truth of our <hi>Concluſion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. Then let us conſider that except we can keep that which is our own we are never the better for it, but a great deal the worſe. Had we a grant of <hi>Midas</hi>'s wiſh, that all we touched ſhould be turned into gold; or were we inſured that all our adventures, ſhould bring us returns as rich as the <hi>Eaſt India</hi> Companies; what ſhould it profit us, if we could notkeep them? Nay, were we not a great deal worſe than without them? What toil and anxiety is there in getting! What fears and troubles are there in keeping! and what ſorrow and vexation in the parting with riches! Not that I think any civil Authority, will ever take away our Eſtates, except we forfeit them through miſdemeanors; but when the <hi>Sword</hi> brings ſuch a <hi>Commiſſion,</hi> I would gladly know who dare deny it? And whether the poor man then, that hath all his money in his purſe-pocket; be not both fafer in his perſon, and more ſecure of his Eſtate; than the rich Merchant, whoſe <hi>bags</hi> and <hi>warehouſes</hi> are filled with his wealth? <hi>Craeſus</hi> was rich even to a Proverb, yet ſhewing to <hi>Solon</hi> all his Treaſures, <hi>Solon</hi> told him, <hi>that if any came with better iron than he wore, they would be maſter of all that Gold.</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:56430:17"/>Now in regard of plundring, depedrations, and all manner of violence by Souldiers both to our perſons and eſtates; I think we are far more ſecure from the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> than <hi>French.</hi> And for this, I ſhall appeal to the <hi>Common experience</hi> of all ages and places where their Armies have come; which bear witneſs, to the great exorbitances of the latter, more than the other; in the violation both of womens chaſtity and mens eſtates, and frequent deſolations by fire and ſword.

Whereas on the contrary, he ſays <hi>England</hi> excel'd them all, in theſe three particulars; <hi>reſpect to the common good, the peoples freedom from in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury, and the little ſpoil their Souldiers and Armies made in their Wars;</hi> the laſt whereof he repeats, and enlarges a little after in the ſame Chapter.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But we will ſuppoſe the beſt in all <hi>uncertainties,</hi> and therefore hope we ſhall eſcape all plundering, and violence from the Souldiers in a time of confuſion; and make no doubt thereof, in a ſetled condition. But yet we know we ſhall not eſcape paying ſuch Taxes, as indeed juſtly deter us, both in regard of their <hi>greatneſs,</hi> and alſo the <hi>arbitrarines</hi> of their Impoſition. In both which we know no people in <hi>Europe</hi> more miſerable than <hi>France,</hi> nor none happier in the contrary, than the Subjects of the Crown of <hi>England.</hi> Which partly occaſioned that known ſaying of the Emperour <hi>Maximilian</hi> the firſt, that he was <hi>Rex regum,</hi> the King of <hi>Spain Rex ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minum,</hi> the King of <hi>France Rex aſinorum,</hi> and the King of <hi>England Rex diabolorum.</hi> For he could have nothing but what the <hi>Germain Princeſs</hi> conſented to, <hi>Spain</hi> only what the Laws allowed him; <hi>France</hi> all that he pleaſed; and <hi>England</hi> nothing that pleaſed not the people.</p>
               <p>As touching their <hi>greatneſs.</hi> 1.

That their <hi>Armies</hi> are often numerous; and ſome always neceſſary, both for defence of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from their domeſtick enemies, and of the Frontiers from foreign, in the adjacent Countries. And that theſe require vaſt ſums to ſupport them. Yet notwithſtanding, thirdly, <hi>Moderation</hi> ought to be uſed, ſo that the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon people may enjoy the fruit of their labours.

We ſhould but tire our ſelves to read, what their own Hiſtorians have rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; and be weary with the rehearſal, of the many tumults and rebellions that have ariſen from their <hi>gabels.</hi> It would fill any one with <hi>ſorrow</hi> to hear of the great <hi>complaints</hi> and <hi>out cries,</hi> that the people have made in former

What remorſe of Conſcience ſeveral of their Kings have had for their extortion, is well known to thoſe that have read their Hiſtories. Some in their life time as <hi>Charles</hi> the eighth; ſome at their death as <hi>Philip</hi> the fourth, who remitted the Taxes he had un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly required, and commanded his Sons to eaſe the people. But above all <hi>Lewis</hi> the eleventh, who reſolved to reform, but it was too late; and therefore charged the <hi>Dauphin</hi> againſt that oppreſſion he had practiſed. And indeed it was highly neceſſary; for he had reduced the common peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to ſuch poverty, that many of the Farmers were forced, with halters a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout their necks to draw their own Plows; except they would ſteal, and once for all, ſtretch both themſelves and ropes on the Gallows. But I ſhould not once mention any of theſe things, if I thought it not better for us, both to know and believe them before hand, than experience them af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards to our coſt. For I fear if we come once under the <hi>French,</hi> there will be no end of paying contributions; until we be brought into the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the <hi>Andrians</hi> of old,<note place="margin">Plut. in vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta Themi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtocl. ex Herodoto.</note> who when <hi>Themiſtocles</hi> demanded money telling them he had brought two <hi>Goddeſſes</hi> to require it, <hi>perſwaſion &amp; pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er;</hi> anſwered that they had two great <hi>Goddeſſes</hi> alſo who taught them to deny it, which were <hi>poverty</hi> and <hi>impoſſibility.</hi> And then the <hi>Hollanders</hi> may do that living,<note place="margin">Procopius decad. <hi>6.</hi> lib. <hi>6.</hi>

But let us be frank in conceding (as it becomes us when we ſpeak
<pb facs="tcp:56430:18"/>of Kings) that there ſhall never ariſe a <hi>Rehoboam</hi> out of <hi>Lewis</hi>'s race; yea that this is as impoſſible, as for a Vulture to riſe out of the Phoenix aſhes: yet we know the beſt of Kings may have bad Governors under them; and that they muſt often, both ſee with other eys, and hear with other ears than their own. Yea let us ſuppoſe, that we ſhall never pay more Tribute to the fair <hi>Lillies</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> than we have done to the <hi>Belgick Lion;</hi> except that of reſpect, which we acknowledge his due: yet there ſtill remains a vaſt difference, betwixt a <hi>legal</hi> and a <hi>permiſſive exemption,</hi> and of the ſame payments made by <hi>publick conſent,</hi> and thoſe that are commanded by abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute <hi>power;</hi> though not in regard of the money, yet in regard both of the authority that requires it, which if abſolute and arbitrary is alterable, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it ſhould not be altered; and the different impreſſions which they make, and effects that follow in the minds and affections of men. For when a people know the neceſſities of State, and freely vote their own Contributions, they account themſelves free and uninjured though the Taxations be never ſo great, (according to the rule, that <hi>volenti non fit in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juria:</hi>) and look upon them as a gift rather than a debt, and therefore pay them willingly, and generouſly bear their parting with their ſhare, Whereas on the contrary, when they are ignorant of the grounds of ſuch impoſitions, they are always jealous, that they are not ſo great as is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended; and when they have no ſuffrage therein, look upon themſelves as wronged and oppreſſed; and though they pay them, yet it is with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luctancy; and becauſe they muſt and cannot withſtand it, their minds are dejected, and their ſpirit and courage ſtrangely depreſt, as I could ſhew by many examples. The difference of theſe two authorities, and their va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and different effects, is well obſerved by two Noble Lords, <hi>Bacon of Verulam,</hi> and <hi>Comines of Argenton;</hi> both of them famous for their wiſdom, one in the Theory and the other in the Practice thereof; ſo that if the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer had had the latters <hi>Prudence,</hi> and the latter the formers <hi>Learning,</hi> no Age could have paralel'd them.

But if Princes will forget, the good adviſe this <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorian</hi> there gives them; yet I wiſh they would remember at leaſt old <hi>Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thagoras</hi>'s Symbol, <hi>Sudorem ferro abſtergere, tetrum facinus.</hi> Which <hi>Plutarch</hi> (as a learned man tells us) expounds, <hi>That none ſhould take away that with the ſword</hi>

                  <hi>which others have earned with the ſweat of their brows.</hi> If they will only uſe their own abſolute power, yet let it be ſo attempered with equity and moderation; that the cries of the poor, and the curſes of the people, may never bring Gods vengeance upon them. But if we ſhould ſpeak the ſenſe of our Souls, we muſt needs (alas!) ſay, that moderation is ſo rare a jewel in the Crown of abſolute Monarchs; and the Governors under them ſo uſed to hunt, and hawk at all game to enrich themſelves: that though we may all hope to eſcape, yet we have more reaſon to fear: that if the fate of the other Provinces befal us, we ſhall all (as the beaſts) ſaid in the fable) <hi>meet at laſt at the Furriers ſhop.</hi> If any can flatter them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with fancies, that our <hi>Common-wealth</hi> ſhall under <hi>France,</hi> become like <hi>Plato</hi>'s <hi>Republick,</hi> wherein violence and <hi>oppreſſion</hi> ſhall not be known; and that their Governors will be like thoſe in <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>topia,</hi> Fathers to our fortunes as much as their own: I muſt confeſs that I am not ſo <hi>Mercurially</hi> made; and do no more expect to ſee the world ſo happy, than to ſee the great <hi>Platonick year.</hi> But on the contrary, that great Impoſitions will be added, to the great Exciſe that is upon us already; whereby the number of the <hi>Poor</hi> will certainly increaſe, and the <hi>proviſions</hi> for them daily decreaſe. Yea it is well, if the maintaining of the <hi>land</hi> againſt the <hi>water,</hi> be not negle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted; and ſo our <hi>Eden</hi> be laid waſte: and that our rich and pompous Cities, return not in time to their old condition, of poor and deſpicable Fiſhers Villages. However, ſeeing the bleſſing of <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Iſſachar,</hi> can never befal the ſame people, as <hi>Bacon</hi> obſerves in the forementioned place, if we and our Eſtates ſhall come under arbitrary power; then let us deface the <hi>Lion Rampant,</hi> that was the Arms of <hi>generous Judah,</hi> which our Anceſtors and we have hitherto born: and ſet up <hi>luggiſh Iſſachar</hi>'s of an <hi>Aſs couchant</hi> between two <hi>burdens,</hi> that is to ſay the <hi>Popes trumperies,</hi> &amp; <hi>France</hi>'s <hi>tribute.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. There is another conſideration, which is of great importance to the Inhabitants of theſe Countries and that is concerning their <hi>Debts.</hi> For mentioning Eſtates, we mean not only that in our own, but alſo that in
<pb facs="tcp:56430:19"/>other mens hands. As for <hi>Private debts,</hi> we know they muſt needs be very many and great in places of ſuch Merchandiſe; ſeeing the greateſt part of trade is all over, and here eſpecially, driven upon credit. Now how theſe will be gotten, if bad time come on, ſo that many remove, and more be impoveriſhed; I leave thoſe to conſider, whoſe concernment it is. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Publick debts,</hi> (which are yet more deſperate, whatever change happens) they are ſuch as are contracted, either for <hi>Service</hi> to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth, and <hi>Commodities</hi> delivered for publick uſes; or for <hi>Monies</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on obligation; all which ways many thouſands are greatly concerned, eſpecially the laſt. There being very many, who have lent, ſome a good part, and others the greateſt part of their Eſtates, upon the <hi>publick faith</hi> of the <hi>Land, Cities</hi> and <hi>Lombards</hi> of theſe Provinces. So that if this <hi>publick faith</hi> prove <hi>faithleſs</hi> like the <hi>Punick</hi> of old, a great number of Families, and (which is moſt deplorable) Widows and Orphans, (who being uncapable to imploy their Eſtates thus intruſted them) will be wholly ruined and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done. Herein I think all that have any ſenſe of juſtice and equity, will conclude with me.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That it is very unreaſonable and unjuſt, that if the preſent Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment cannot diſcharge theſe debts, or a change happens; that thoſe who have credited the Republick, ſhould ſit down with all the loſs, and others not bear their proportion.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That ſeeing they were lent to the Publick, and Obligation accordingly given; and that for publick uſes, and ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed, (or if other-ways converted, yet without the Creditors fault:) it is all the reaſon in the world, that the Publick ſhould faithfully pay the ſame.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That if the Republick ſtand, care ought to be taken to ſatistic theſe Creditors: and that if a change of Government happen, the people remaining the ſame, are both in Law and equity liable to pay theſe debts. For though it is a great queſtion how far Subjects are obliged to pay their Soveraigns; yet it was never queſtioned by any, but that ſuch as are made for the Publick by the peoples tacit, and much more expreſs conſent; muſt be paid by the people, what ever change be made in the Government. Whether from a Monarchy to a Republick,<note place="margin">Demoſthen adv. Lep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin. V. Diſqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit. politic. <hi>53.</hi>
                  </note> as the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munality of <hi>Athens</hi> paid the 100 Talents which their 30 Tyrants had bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed of the <hi>Lacedemonians;</hi> and theſe very Provinces, that which the King of <hi>Spain</hi> was indebted to the people: Or from a Republick to a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy; <hi>Non deſinit debere pecuniam populus rege ſibi impoſito, quam liber debebat; eſt enim idem populus, &amp; dominium retinet eorum quae populi fuerant; imò &amp; imperium inſe retinet, quanquam jam non exercendum à corpore ſed à capite,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Grotius de jure belli &amp; pacis, l.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 9. <hi>Sect.</hi> 8. See alſo <hi>Arniſaeus de rep. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 5. <hi>Sect.</hi> 4. <hi>Quatenus acta Reip. obligent civitatem,</hi> and the Civilians <hi>de rebus creditis, Digeſt. lib.</hi> 11. <hi>tit.</hi> 1. <hi>l.</hi> 27.</p>
               <p>All the <hi>difficulty</hi> therefore will be if a <hi>change come,</hi> how the <hi>payment</hi> of theſe juſt debts may be procured. And here we need no other <hi>Counſellors</hi> advice, than our own reaſon, which will inform us, that the freer any people are
<pb facs="tcp:56430:20"/>and the more they participate of power; the more probable it is, and alſo the more facile for them to obtain their rights. Now that we are likely to have more freedom under <hi>England</hi> than <hi>France,</hi> I have ſhewn ſufficiently in the former Section. Yea common experience as well as reaſon hath learnt the world this leſſon; that when inferiors can only pray and peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, they may daily get fair promiſes, and perhaps be ſprinkled with ſome <hi>Court-holy-water;</hi> but performances and payments are ſtill the work of to morrow, and continually kept as <hi>reſerves</hi> in the <hi>rear.</hi> Nor can they biing more arguments for their expedition, than Superiors have excuſes for their delaying: and if at laſt their patience be worn as thread-bare, as their clothes with attendance; ſo that they become importune in requeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; then <hi>Grandees</hi> grow deaf in hearing, and reſolvedly peremptory in denying: whence both ſides frequently fall to irregular proceedings; the one for recovering, and the other for defrauding them of their rights. Whereas thoſe that can, not only requeſt, but alſo legally require, that juſtice be done; have ground to hope, that when the touchines of times is over, and the boiſterous paſſions of great ones are laid; ſome happy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juncture of affairs may prove a proſperous gale to bring them at laſt, their hazardous adventures home in ſafety.</p>
               <p n="4">4. and laſtly, (that I may draw this arrow to the head) I ſhall deſire that we may conſider a little of the Lands and Revenues, formerly belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the <hi>Romiſh Church.</hi> Which to defend our ſelves in our Wars with <hi>Spain,</hi> were ſold to ſeveral, and are ſince parcelled out into many more hands. Now the very mentioning of this I ſhould think ſufficient; the difference between <hi>France</hi> and <hi>England</hi> herein, being ſo well known. Do we hear what the former hath already done, in all thoſe places ſubject to him, and how they have ſet up all the Romiſh rable; and can we think that they will not in time recover (what ever promiſes they paſs for the preſent) that which not only they themſelves, but all of their Religion account their right? Can we imagine that their <hi>Biſhops, Abbots, Priors,</hi> and other Superior Orders, will live like <hi>Parochials</hi> or <hi>Mendicant Friers?</hi> Who is ſo ignorant as knows not, that where ever the <hi>old Gentleman of Rome</hi> comes to rule, he brings with him many attendants to bear up his train; and that their pomp muſt be ſupported, though many <hi>Gentlemen</hi> thereby be ruined? Whereas on the contrary, <hi>England</hi> is by them, in the ſame condemnation with our ſelves; neither permitting his headſhip and dominion over them, nor his members and followers any demains among them. So that we may ſafely conclude, that all thoſe that poſſes ſuch Eſtates, as the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> doth challenge; can neither rationally hope to keep them under <hi>France,</hi> nor fear to loſe them under <hi>England.</hi>

               <p>WE are now come to the <hi>Acropolis</hi> of the cauſe; <hi>Trade</hi> being the great <hi>Tower of ſtrength,</hi> to which the Adverſaries of our opinion, having deſerted the former out-works, uſually ſly unto our refuge. We ſhall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore perſue them; but orderly, firſt making our <hi>approaches</hi> by degrees; and them raiſing ſuch batteries, and planting ſuch <hi>reaſons,</hi> as are forcible, either to beat this down, or at leaſt make ſuch breaches therein, as ſhall render it untenable for their defence; and ſo compel the moſt pertinacious of our enemies, either to ſubmit, or to fall before us.</p>
               <p>But before we begin this work, we muſt acquaint you, that when we mention <hi>Trade,</hi> we mean not every particular kind of negotiation, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the ſeveral ſorts of Artificers and Shop-keepers are imployed; to ſpeak of which would be both an endleſs, an a bootleſs work. Herein perhaps ſome might fare better with the <hi>French,</hi> the <hi>Mercers</hi> and <hi>Tailers</hi> eſpecially; for the <hi>à la mode Monſieurs</hi> when they have money, affect to change their faſhion as often as the <hi>Moon</hi> doth her face; and to wear as many ribbands on their breeches, as ordinary Pedlers bear on their backs; as if all the fortunes of <hi>France</hi> hung at their ends, and all their own happineſs followed their heels. And happily <hi>Butchers</hi> and <hi>Cooks</hi> would fare better with the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> for a <hi>piece of good Beef</hi> or a <hi>Shoulder of Mutton.</hi> And we might in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in many others with merriment; but we have no mind to be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant upon ſo ſerious a Subject. In ſhort therefore, we mean <hi>Maritime Trade</hi> (as our Adverſaries do) this being the great <hi>Diana</hi> of the <hi>Nether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands,</hi> which brings them in their Silver Shrines.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Then we ſhall lay down this as a fundamental and undoubted <hi>Maxim,</hi> (which all I think will take for granted) that <hi>trade by Sea is the great ſecular intereſt of theſe Provinces, the Maritime eſpecially, by which they moſt flouriſh, and without which they cannot ſubſiſt.</hi> Let <hi>Amſterdam</hi> and the other <hi>Cities</hi> be as rich, or richer then they are imagined; yet will they in a few years, if their Trade be obſtructed, become as poor as their Neighbours at <hi>Gant,</hi> or <hi>Antwerp.</hi> For who will build at ſuch exceſſive charges (where the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation ſometimes is half to the ſuperſtructure) or pay ſuch rents for their habitation, and live in ſuch expenſive places, if there be not freedom of Trade? But thoſe that can, will remove; ſome hither and ſome thither, as their intereſt and affection ſhall incline them;<note place="margin">Eſſay (or Sermo fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delis) <hi>19.</hi>
                  </note> rather then ſpend their <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitalls</hi> here. If ever Merchants were, or are in any place of the world, the <hi>vena porta</hi> (as <hi>Bacon</hi> ſtiles them) of any publick body, it is certainly the
<pb facs="tcp:56430:21"/>
                  <hi>Belgick.</hi> If they fraight not their Ships, whereby the Marriners may be imployed; if they furniſh not the Tradeſmen ſhops, whereby they may follow their Vocations; if they lade not the poor mens backs, whereby their Families may fill their bellies; finally, if they diſtribute not their Merchandiſe through the various Seas and Rivers of the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſe:</hi> we may linger a while, but it is as impoſſible we ſhould live long, as for a body de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of food, whoſe parts languiſh for want of nouriſhment, which ſhould be brought them in the veins, by the bloods regular <hi>circulation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Merchandiſe being our chief concernment, it will neceſſarily follow that that Nation that can moſt obſtruct the ſame, can do us moſt injury. Now that <hi>England</hi> can do this more than <hi>France,</hi> or any other whatſoever, I think none will deny; if any do, there is enough ſaid hereafter, that will make it ſufficiently apparent.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Of all our neighbouring Nations, <hi>England</hi> being moſt potent by Sea, and <hi>France</hi> by Land, it will clearly follow, that a Peace with theſe two above all others, is our great concernment, With the former for getting, and with the latter for keeping and enjoying our Eſtates. But if we cannot have this from them both, which of them is to be preferred comes next in conſideration.</p>
               <p n="4">4. This Common-wealth conſiſting of <hi>Maritime</hi> and <hi>Inland Provinces,</hi> the former being by far the moſt conſiderable, the friendſhip of <hi>England</hi> is more to be valued than that of <hi>France.</hi> And this the wiſeſt men that this <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick</hi> ever had, formerly never doubted. of Prince <hi>William</hi> the Firſt founder of this Common-wealth, laid down theſe three principal maximes of State, which were approved by all, as ſound and rational beyond contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction.
<list>
                     <item>1. <hi>To do juſtice to Strangers.</hi> For great Nations may be upheld by Power, but ſmall Territories muſt be maintained by Juſtice.</item>
                     <item>2. <hi>To hold a fair correſpondence with France.</hi> For <hi>Spain</hi> being then the grand <hi>Monarchy</hi> of <hi>Europe,</hi> and our dreadful enemy; the aſſiſtance of <hi>France</hi> was greatly ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for our ſupportation.</item>

It is true of later times, the <hi>Loveſteiners</hi> to free themſelves, from the Headſhip of the <hi>Orange</hi> family; which ſought (as they imagined) either an abſoluteneſs, or at leaſt to infringe the liberty of the Common-wealth, have been rather inclined to <hi>France</hi> and <hi>England:</hi> but they were not ſo blinded with paſſion, but that having a Peace with <hi>Spain,</hi> and being ſenſible of <hi>France's</hi> prevalen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and raiſing their Fortunes upon the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> ruines, it was their Intereſt to comply with <hi>England</hi> rather than <hi>France.</hi> Which plainly appears, in that no ſooner was thoſe unhappy differences between us and <hi>England</hi>

To the reaſon of State already mentioned, together with the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our greateſt <hi>Politicians</hi> both in former and later times, let me add; that Terreſtrial war hath always been accounted more eligible than a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val; yea by ſome our abſolute intereſt, as the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Rhoan</hi> obſerves. In ſo much that <hi>Zeeland</hi> never to this day conſented unto,<note place="margin">l' Intreſt des Prine. &amp; Eſt. diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour. <hi>6.</hi>

If we had the Sea free for our inferior <hi>Provinces,</hi> the charges of a Land-war for the ſuperior were eaſily borne. And we ſhould not want men enow for our money, to fight for them with <hi>France,</hi> or any other whatſoever, ſo long as we ſhould think them worth the fighting for. Nor let any wonder that I inſert ſuch a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional; for I ſhall afterwards make it appear, how the Common-wealth may be well ſecured, though theſe Provinces ſhould be let go or loſt. And as for the inferior, they are ſo ſituated in the water, and thereby ſo inacceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible; that we need not fear, what all the force of <hi>France</hi> can do, if we be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to defend them. It being therefore apparent that Traffick is our principal concernment, and <hi>England</hi> of all others moſt able to obſtruct it; we may conclude in point of intereſt, as Prince <hi>Maurice</hi> (I have heard) uſed to ſay, that <hi>were the Engliſh Devils, we muſt have peace with them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe being the <hi>Approaches,</hi> (which I think) no ſallies of our Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries can prevent; we ſhall now, being got nearer them, take a better view of their ſtrength. Were we free and had our choice, whether we ſhould war with <hi>France</hi> or <hi>England,</hi> you ſee our intereſt ſhould carry us againſt <hi>France.</hi> But the caſe (alas!) is far otherwiſe with us, for they both make war upon us: by what error of policy one of them, which could beſt, was not taken off and diverted, if it had been poſſible, or whether it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible, and ſo no error or omiſſion in us, is not now our enquiry. But ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they both threaten us with deſtruction, upon ſuppoſition that we are unable any longer to reſiſt them both, whether of them we ſhould chooſe to be under in regard of our <hi>Trade.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This then being the Queſtion; our Adverſaries give their ſuffrage for <hi>France;</hi> and think themſelves impregnable in this point of intereſt. Let us therefore impartially repreſent the ſtrength of their reaſons, and weigh them duly in the true ballance of intereſt, and then we ſhall find them you ſhall ſee, not only many grains but ounces too light.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:56430:22"/>
               <p n="1">1. It is better for us, ſay they, to be under <hi>France,</hi> becauſe <hi>England</hi> and and we are Competitors for Trade.</p>
               <p>It is very true, <hi>England</hi> and theſe Countries by their ſituation, genious, and intereſt are ſet for Trade: and this naturally begets an enmity between us, and a vying with one another for the ſame. But this was always, and will be ſo whilſt men are men: and what will follow hence? Surely one of theſe things, either that we muſt willingly yield to them, or they to us, which is madneſs to imagine; or that we muſt fight with them for the whole, which if they mean of our ſelves, is the next degree to dotage, ſeeing we are about matches, and Peace in their trade is always the intereſt of a trading people; if they mean jointly with <hi>France,</hi> we ſhall ſpeak to that in the following Argument, and ſhew what a hazard even that will be, and much more ſingly: or that we muſt compound with them for our ſhare, that ſo each Nation may have, what Gods bleſſing may give, and their own induſtry may procure them. And this in my opinion will have the vote, not only of all the Cowards, but all the wiſe men of both Nations. But becauſe this Argument is much inſiſted on, both in former times and this juncture of affairs; we will more particularly conſider the ſame, in reference to this Common-wealth as to <hi>England</hi> abſolutely without reſpect to <hi>France.</hi> And thereby we ſhall ſee what corrivals in Trade implies in point of Intereſt, whether the power be about equal, (as we ſhall here ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe <hi>England</hi> and this Common-wealths) or unequal, and in point of infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence. Now in regard of Intereſt, we ſhall find in my judgment, that 'tis clearly this for us as equal in power.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That we muſt vigorouſly defend our Trade, as that on which our temporal welfare depends.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That we muſt for this purpoſe, maintain a naval power, equal at leaſt to theirs. That ſo we may hold them up, to the juſt and due terms, and bounds, of Commerce and Navigation.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That for this end the league of the Maritime Provinces be kept in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>violable. If the band of the bunch of arrows be either cut or broken, ſo that they fall out of the Lions paw; he will ſoon have his skin pull'd over his ears. So that to make ſeveral Common-wealths of them, is but to make them ſo many morſels to be the eaſilier devoured by their enemies. And therefore I wonder at the Author of the <hi>Intereſt of Holland</hi> herein, who, <hi>c.</hi> 41.42. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> aſſerts the power of that Province ſufficient by Sea, and jointly with <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>trecht</hi> by Land, to wage War with all other Potentates. Seeing theſe Maritime Provinces entirely conſidered, are but the match at Sea for <hi>England.</hi> And the reaſons that he gives, <hi>c.</hi> 37. are now refuted by experience. I acknowledge it alſo an error in policy, for <hi>Zeeland</hi> to break this bond of Amity, if poſſibly they can help it. But if their Enemies ſword cuts this aſunder, what ſhall they do? And this is the caſe only that I defend.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That we ſhould rather yield to them in <hi>Punctillioes</hi> of honour; that
<pb facs="tcp:56430:22"/>being a <hi>Crown,</hi> this only a Common-wealth. Such I mean as the <hi>Flag;</hi> although I reckon not that any diſhonour to us, ſeeing they have not only always challenged it, but our Anceſtors alſo given it: and other Nations as well as we, pay the ſame acknowledgment to that <hi>Crown.</hi> The firſt time that we have ever refuſed it, was in the time of King <hi>James;</hi> the circumſtances whereof Sr. <hi>Anthony Welden</hi> in his <hi>Court</hi> relates, and the effects both their and our Hiſtorians. It is not my deſign to ſpeak of this particular, which would ſwell to a diſcourſe larger then this whole Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe; but only inſtance therein, as a known example; concluding that if they will War for it, it is our wiſdom to yield it, and except we were far ſtronger than they, folly to fight for it.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Rather to diſſemble leſſer injuries than ſeek to revenge them. Which holds in all equalities of power whatſoever.</p>

               <p>I know ſome that have more of <hi>Mars</hi> than <hi>Mercurie</hi>'s temper, are all for fighting, and therefore I ſhall deſire them calmly to conſider, theſe few particulars following.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. What either we or <hi>England</hi> have gotten by our former Wars, when matcht in power. I partly know what it hath coſt us both, in treaſure and blood: and can demonſtrate that if either hath gotten, 'tis <hi>England,</hi> though not to countervail the coſt. Let's but reckon (as we muſt if we go rightly to work) the <hi>lucrum ceſſens,</hi> and <hi>damnum emergens,</hi> or the profit that ceaſes, and loſs that accrues, and vvhat vve have got, vve may put in our eye, and not ſee much the vvorſe,
<pb facs="tcp:56430:23"/>
                     <p>But if any one ſay who can reckon that, or how?</p>
                     <p>I ſhall freely acknowledge that to pounds and perſons we cannot, nor no man alive; yet in the general we may, ſo far as to make a judgment. I have done it for my own ſatisfaction, and ſhall tell you how; that ſo thoſe that are curious may ſatisfy themſelves therein, and not take it upon my credit. By the publick Cuſtoms; the Number of ſhips, the Capital where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with Trade is driven; and by the riches of the Merchants. Of theſe, the two former are more eaſie and certain, wherein <hi>England</hi> hath increaſed: the two latter more conjectural, wherein this Republick hath the ſuperiori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. But hath not gotten it by the wars, but ariſes from ſeveral other cauſes, (which I could mention) and eſpecially from theſe two following, which I think will ſatisfy any intelligent man. As to the Capital, ours comes to be greater, in regard that as the Merchants grow rich in <hi>England,</hi> they buy land, and breed up their ſons to be Country gentlemen; whereas we, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in <hi>Holland,</hi> continue the ſtock and our children in the Trade. Land being here at 35 and 40 years purchaſe, and in <hi>England</hi> at 15 or 20 ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily. And that the Merchants here ſhould be richer than there, is no wonder to me; who know ſo well the frugality of the one, and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digality of the other.</p>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. Let it be conſidered how difficult and hazardous it is for equal powers, to deſtroy one another; and therefore how litle likelihood there is, of any thing to be gotten by conteſting. Nay there are ſeveral circumſtances in our ſituations, imployments, and people, that render abſolute conqueſt almoſt impoſſible. We may like Cooks fight, and breath, and fight again, and crow over one another for ſome victories, but far from a conqueſt. And this we might both have ſeen long ſince in the glas of policy: which clearly ſhows, that ſuch equal powers fighting for profit, is but like <hi>Nero's</hi> fiſhing with a golden hook, wherein more is adventured, than ever is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be gotten. We have had a Comick-tragedy, and a tragick comedy of two wars, and <hi>England</hi> the contrary; wherein our enemies indeed have been pleaſant ſpectators, and ſatisfied their envious eyes, but what have either of us got, but blowes? Paſſion and prejudice are ſo prevalent in the World, and ſo blind the eyes of men, that often they will not ſee the truth, till dear-bought experience makes them even to feel it. And this we now both ſee, and therefore <hi>England</hi> takes this opportunity of breaking down the equality of power, and bringing us lower, that ſo we may truckle un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them, and they be at reſt in the bed of ſecurity.</item>
                  <item>3. Thoſe that are ſo much for <hi>Mars,</hi> might do well to conſider, the advantages and diſadvantages of both Nations, for carrying on, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting under long wars. In ſome things we may happily have the advantage, as in bearing the charges, number of ſhipping, Caping by Letters of Marque &amp;c. And in others <hi>England,</hi> for they have a great and rich Inland Country,<note place="margin">l'Intreſtdes Princes. Diſcours 7.</note> an Hand that cannot be eaſily diverted by a Land-war, ſo that as the <hi>Duke of Rhoan</hi> ſaith right, <hi>l' Angleterre eſt un grand animal, qui ne peut
<pb facs="tcp:56430:23"/>jamais mourir, ſ'il ne ſe tuë luimeſme.</hi> We ſubſiſt wholly on Trade, and fetch all things from abroad, they have ſufficiency of neceſſaries from their own growth at home. When Trade ſtands ſtill, they have cloths for the back, and meat for the belly, better cheap for the poorer people: here not only ſuch accommodations are far dearer than there, which can well be born when Trade flouriſheth; but when that is ſtopt, and it can worſt be endured, then are they deareſt of all. Our Seamen which come moſt from the Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern quarters about the <hi>Baltick</hi> Sea, to ſerve us in Navigation; when they ſee no hopes of gain, but only venturing their lives for the pay of the Wars, will remove and ſerve other Nations: whereas the King of <hi>England</hi> hath three Kingdoms to preſs out for his aſſiſtance, according to the cuſtom of the Crown there, which is not practiſed nor indeed practicable in this Free State. And although at the firſt ſuch as are preſt be averſe to the Wars; yet we find and feel by experience, that what through the Officers and Gentlemens careſſing and encouraging them, what through company and converſing with others before-hand, this reſtineſs is worn off by degrees; and through the principles of ſelf defence, and ſome ſparks of the honour of their Country, they fight well enough, whatever the cauſe or the quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel be.</item>
                  <item>4. I wiſh both Nations would well conſider, whether whilſt we two are ſo eagerly conteſting for Trade, others may not carry it away. I have rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably conſidered what Nation can bid the fareſt for this, in regard of their <hi>Situation, Havens, Genious, &amp;c.</hi> the ad vantages of the <hi>Mediterranean</hi> and <hi>Baltick</hi> Seas, and let my thoughts ſtretch themſelves as far as both the <hi>Indies:</hi> have obſerved the <hi>French</hi> Fleet, the darling of the King and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, their hopes with the grounds of them, and the probable ſucceſs there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, as alſo the communication of <hi>Spain</hi> with <hi>America;</hi> and find no one Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion alone capacitated to carry away our Commerce; but ſeveral to have greater ſhares than they have at preſent. Yea, to ſpeak my mind freely, I have had far further contemplations, and of a far different kind from theſe upon this Subject, in reſpect to future times. And indeed ſuch as have often made me both very ſorrowful to ſee the Chriſtian world ſo mad and quarelſom about their Commerce, and very fearful that God would either blaſt it to us, by taking it away and giving it to <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Heathens;</hi> or not bleſs us with it, giving us herein our hearts deſire in his wrath, and them the Goſpel in exchange thereof. As I clearly ſee he hath done to the <hi>Jews,</hi> the generalleſt and greateſt Merchants of the World: and as I think he threatens us Chriſtians in ſeveral places of <hi>holy Scripture,</hi> if they be du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſidered. But becauſe I love not dogmatizing, or to be poſitive in things I am not ſo fully ſatisfied in; I ſhall at preſent ſay no more of this, but leave it to every good Chriſtians conſideration.</item>

Now all theſe have many particulars conteined in them. For example in the firſt to gain time, by ſending Embaſſadors, and ſo ſtill that as one is returning another may be ſent: whereby a fair pretence of ignorance of tranſactions may be pleaded, and time ſpun out in further debates. By con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding one thing after another by degrees, ſtill reſerving the principal point of Intereſt entire, &amp;c. And ſo of the reſt within the bounds of honeſt Policy. The reaſon of the caſe is ſo clear, that were it not for mens paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, inferiors in power would not be ſo ready to fight. For let them either be beaten or beat, it will redound at laſt to their own deſtruction. If the former, why ſhould they ſpend their blood and treaſure to make themſelves more miſerable? and if the latter, they do but enrage their enemies the more, who being more powerful will not for two or three Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tells end the War, and come to a Peace to their great diſhonour. So that we may lay down this as a general rule for the weaker ſide, <hi>That ſelf defence muſt be firſt for preparation, but laſt for execution.</hi> Of all the Princes of <hi>Europe</hi> in our age, the Duke of <hi>Lorraign</hi> hath been the cunningeſt game<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, but the fouleſt player with ſtronger powers. But oh, how is he catch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in his own craftineſs! Although I confeſs I could not ſee him and his Court (as I have done ſince his diſaſter) without great commiſeration; to think that one of the ancienteſt Families and greatlieſt allyed of all <hi>Europe,</hi> ſhould fall into that condition. Of the former age the <hi>Verinians,</hi> who
<pb facs="tcp:56430:24"/>being oppreſt by their Neighbours the <hi>Venetians,</hi> that were more power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, would notwithſtanding needs War with them; wherein though they were often victorious, yet it proved their ruine at laſt, for which they are ſtigmatized for Fools to all ſucceeding Generations. And many other examples might be produced, but I think them needleſs in ſo plain a caſe.</p>
               <p>And thus you ſee what our being competitors for Trade implies as to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in regard of War and Peace. Which I have been the larger upon, becauſe I know what work fools make wiſe men in both Nations. I have many times been put to it for patience, and ſometimes into a Paroxiſm of paſſion, to hear the ſenſleſs clamors of men. We are Competitors for Trade! It is our Intereſt! Our Intereſt! Down with the <hi>Dutch!</hi> Down with the <hi>Engliſh!</hi> Let us but conſider who theſe are, and we ſhall find them. Men that have a pound of paſſion, for one ounce of reaſon. Men that never ſaw, or at leſt not well obſerved both Nations. Men that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver beſtowed one calm hour to ballance their powers. For wiſe men that knew both well, was but grieved to hear, or pleaſantly merry with ſuch madneſs. I publickly decryed ſuch folly in the firſt Wars, and had ſeverely chaſtiſed ſuch fools in the ſecond, if I had not been ſeveral ways hindred. Let me ſay it freely (I think I have ſome reaſon, for I believe there are few men that have better viewed both Nations with their eye, to that end which I have had, nor ballanced their power with greater accuracy) that if either the King of Great <hi>Britain,</hi> or the States, or both require it: I am ready to demonſtrate, that for theſe 20 or 30 years laſt paſt, there was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of advantage rationally to be expected on either ſide, that can coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervail a War: nor as both might manage their power, likely to be, ſo long as both continued in that condition, for in powers about equal, all the difference is in the management thereof. And becauſe I ſee what work is made in the world, if I live to ſee the ballance come ſo even again, (though I think I never ſhall) I do here engage, for the publick peace of Proteſtants, and good of both Nations, to ſatisfie all rational men herein, I hope even to curioſity. And ſhall, if God ſpares me life and health, defend the ſame, againſt all the State-tinkers of both Nations; although I well know, they have great ſtore of ſmall Tools, with which they make a ratling in their Budgets.</p>
               <p>Let us now proceed to ſuch inferences as our Adverſaries make from this competition in Trade.</p>
               <p>Some argue thus, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> minding Trade more than the <hi>French,</hi> they may come and live among us and carry away our Commerce.</p>
               <p>In my apprehenſion, there's more fear of their Souldiers coming hither than their Merchants. But ſuppoſe more Merchants did come, would that be any worſe for us? I have heard ſeveral of the greateſt Merchan<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s of both Nations ſay, the more in a place and better, though I confeſs it is not ſo for Shopkeepers. But for this they may reſt ſecure, thoſe that knovv the cheapneſs of living in <hi>England,</hi> in compariſon of theſe Countries, will
<pb facs="tcp:56430:25"/>abundantly ſatisfie them that fear this. Yea I ſhall ſhew hereafter that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> would have more reaſon to fear, that we ſhould come thither, and deprive them of their Trades. Yet to ſay the truth, I ſee not that either need fear, were we under the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> that either Nation ſhould ſuffer hereby; ſeeing all have had freedom that will to remove formerly, and that hath made ſo ſmall an alteration as to the ballance of Trade, that it is inconſiderable. For if I make my calculation right, there is not much difference, of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> here, and the <hi>Dutch</hi> in <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Others argue we are Corrivals for Trade, that is the Miſtreſs we both Court, and therefore one muſt marry it.</p>
               <p>But this is but a toyiſh Sophiſm, when men will compare Commerce to a Miſtreſs, that one only can marry. For
<list>
                     <item>1. The world is wide enough, and the Sea large enough for both Nations to exerciſe their skill and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry.</item>
                     <item>2. If we think to betroth all Trade, and ingroſs it to our ſelves alone; other Nations will come in and forbid the banes, as well as <hi>England,</hi> as I ſhall ſhew hereafter.</item>
                     <item>3. If we two could ſo happily agree, and ſo ſettle Commerce as it might perhaps be ſetled; we might bid fair for carrying it, or at leaſt for retaining it betwixt us And ſo far as my ſhort ſight can reach, this ſeems to me the mark aimed at on both ſides, by thoſe who have the direction of affairs, which I do not deſpair to ſee effected.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>Seeing then we are in as much danger, that I ſay not more, to loſe that part of Trade we have, as to gain more by our conteſting; I hope all rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal men will grant it our Intereſt, that <hi>England</hi> and we ſo compound for it, that each of us may have what <hi>Gods</hi> bleſſing, and juſtice, and equity gives to eithers induſtry. And this I am ſure was the wiſdom of former times. I have ſhown it already in part on our ſide, and could much more largely both for us and the <hi>Engliſh.</hi> In Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> time we were not grown up to our preſent greatneſs. In King <hi>James</hi>'s time, who all the world knows was no Martial man, but in his temper as well as <hi>motto</hi> truly paci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick, the Cautionary Towns that <hi>England</hi> poſſeſt in theſe Countries, were A. 1616. ranſomed, and we grew up to that greatneſs of being an equal match for them in power at Sea. And this the <hi>Engliſh</hi> account the great error of Political Intereſt; although they muſt needs acknowledge it but fair and honeſt dealing. King <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt, that Prince of bleſſed and immortal memory, ſeeing how he grew up, not only kept a fair cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondency with us, but having experience how croſs Parliaments were to the Court, ſo that no<hi rend="sup">o</hi> War could be carried on, did by a fair correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence keep friendſhip with us; and not only ſo, but married his eldeſt Daughter to the <hi>Prince of Orange</hi> for this reaſon of State amongſt others. For being jealous of this Common-wealth's favouring that party in his Kingdoms, which was then called by the Court <hi>Puritans,</hi> and ſeeing the growing greatneſs of this State by Sea, did for theſe two reaſons of State, engage the Prince and this Common-wealth by that Marriage. And this was alſo the reaſon of State in <hi>Oliver</hi>'s time when Peace was made, that we muſt
<pb facs="tcp:56430:25"/>accord for our mutal Trade. How it hath been ſince we all know, and therefore I need not mention it. And this is the firſt weapon our enimies uſe, which you ſee if we meaſure rightly, is too ſhort to touch, much leſs mortally to wound, the truth of that cauſe that we maintain.</p>
               <p>Yet we muſt do our Adverſaries right: the wiſer ſort of them upon the ſuppoſal of equal powers, (as we have formerly been, and which is that I have hitherto ſpoke of) are for peace, and judge it the Intereſt of both Nations; but they think our coming under <hi>France</hi> will render <hi>England</hi> ſo unequal and inferior a match for us, that we cannot in all humane appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance miſs of marrying our beloved Lady <hi>Trade,</hi> and clearly carrying her from our Corrival. And I confeſs ingenouſly if there be any thing of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to be ſaid for <hi>France,</hi> 'tis this.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Therefore our Adverſaries are for <hi>France,</hi> becauſe thereby we ſhould be able to beat <hi>England</hi> out of their Trade, and ſo become maſters of the whole, or the greateſt part at leaſt of the Sea negotiation.</p>
               <p>Now becauſe they ſo much triumph in this, though before the victory; we will examin it thorowly, and ſee what probability there is of obtaining the greateſt part of Trade by this means.</p>
               <p n="1">1. We grant that <hi>England</hi> and this <hi>Republick</hi> being about an equal match at Sea; the acceſſion of <hi>France</hi> would clearly make us an overmatch for <hi>England,</hi> if all was true which they ſuppoſe.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But therein is their miſtake, that they take theſe two things for grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, which are both falſe. Firſt that theſe Maritime Provinces ſhould entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly become <hi>French.</hi> And ſecondly that all other Nations will ſtand neutral; ſo that we ſhall have no more to do, but <hi>France</hi> and we entirely to deal with <hi>England</hi> alone.</p>
               <p>Now how far this is from truth, we ſhall make abundantly apparent, and by ballancing of powers how little probability there is, of theſe their deſignes becoming practicable, and ſuch as will effect their deſires.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Hereby they ſuppoſe a War, and ſuch a long and tedious one, as perhaps we may not live to ſee ended. For we cannot rationally imagine the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſuch tame <hi>animals,</hi> that they will eaſily part with their Trade: but muſt ſuppoſe they will ſet all at ſtake, before that jewel of the Land be loſt. Now let us but calmly conſider, how deſtructive ſuch a War will be to our Trade, and what advantages they have above us of ſubſiſting un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a long War, ſome of which we have before mentioned; and I do believe no wiſe man will think this our Intereſt, except there was a greater likeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of a ſudden ſubduing them, then is rationally to be exſpected, as we ſhall preſently make apparent. Now on the contraty, if we come under <hi>England,</hi> there is no fear of a War with <hi>France</hi> at Sea; that Kingdom being ſo much inferior in maritime power to either of us, and much more to both. And ſhould we have a Land-war with <hi>France,</hi> yet that is more eligible for us than one by Sea, in the opinion of all wiſe men, as we have formerly ſhown, and ſhall have occaſion hereafter more fully.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:56430:26"/>
               <p n="2">2. A War with <hi>England</hi> being ſuppoſed, as it muſt, (for we muſt either ſay we can and will have the Trade alone or the greateſt part thereof <hi>invitis Anglis,</hi> or we ſay nothing to the purpoſe) the readieſt way to ſee what pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability there is for conquering them, and conſequently carrying the Trade; will be firſt by ballancing of powers, and then by ſome other Conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. The former of theſe we ſhall do with reſpect to <hi>Zeeland,</hi> and then with reſpect to other Nations.</p>
               <p>For the firſt it muſt be conſidered that <hi>Zeeland</hi> hath expreſly decare <hi>that they will not come under France, but that if they cannot defend themſelves, they will then ſubmit to England.</hi> It is true (as I have ſaid) it is the intereſt of theſe maritime Provinces to keep their League; but if their enemies Sword cuts it aſſunder, and they will not venture the loſs of their Religion and Liberty under <hi>France,</hi> who ſhall hinder them? They are free ſurely to diſpoſe of themſelves as well as <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>trecht,</hi> or the other Provinces. For in coordinate Powers, when their confederacy is broken, either by themſelves or their enimies; each are at liberty, and in their former freedom, to diſpoſe of themſelves, as they ſhall think fit. And though <hi>Freeſland</hi> hath not declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſo that if they ſhould come to the utmoſt extremity, we know not but they might happily incline to <hi>England</hi> alſo; yet becauſe that is uncertain, we will be liberal in granting our Adverſaries even that which they cannot prove, and take to our ſelves only that we can, and ſo proceed upon infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible grounds.</p>
               <p>Nor let any one here ſtop me, and ſay that in taking it for granted that <hi>Zeeland</hi> will be <hi>Engliſh,</hi> I may be miſtaken, for they may beat off their enemies and defend themſelves. I grant it, although by the way let me ſay it, I ſee but little likelihood of that; for of above 100 Companies they pay, there is as yet not one in their principalleſt Ilands (though how it comes ſo, becomes not me to enquire) but the thing is to me matter of admiration. But I will ſhew you how I reaſon; not from the War, that <hi>England</hi> will conquer <hi>Zeeland,</hi> nor from the Agreement betwixt the two Crownes, which yet is generally ſaid brings us under that: but upon ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal that we are tired out with the War, and come to treat with our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies (for I hope no man is ſo mad, as to think theſe Provinces will as <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>trecht,</hi> call them in, and after make what tearms we can get, but treat with them with our weapons in our hands) <hi>Zeelands</hi> not only <hi>Declaration,</hi> but <hi>Inclination</hi> carries them for <hi>England.</hi> So that which way ſoever we take conqueſt by our enemies, their diſpoſing of us, or our own diſpoſal of our ſelves, <hi>Zeeland</hi> is ſtill <hi>Engliſh.</hi> So that upon the ſuppoſition of inabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity to defend our ſelves, we are morally certain, that <hi>Zeeland</hi> will fall to <hi>England:</hi> and our Adverſaries uncertain, that <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Frieſland</hi> will chooſe <hi>France.</hi> But we will grant them all they can reaſonably deſire, <hi>viz.</hi> that theſe two Provinces make ſuch a choice, and thereupon proceed to the ballancing of Powers.</p>
               <p>Now in Naval ſtrength, <hi>Zeeland</hi> hath the proportion of a ſixt part in
<pb facs="tcp:56430:26"/>this Republick; there being 5 Admiralities, wherein <hi>Amſterdam</hi> hath a double rate, we will ſuppoſe any number for a Fleet greater or leſs to be ſet out by them. For example, the States equip a Fleet of 72 Sail herein.</p>

               <p>Although I know in the <hi>quota</hi> or Tax to the Publick, <hi>Frieſland</hi> is more: but that is becauſe of their greater ſhare in the Land, which is a certain revenue, and Trade only a contingency. In ſtrength then at Sea we ſee, that <hi>Zeeland,</hi> at leſt ballances <hi>Frieſland</hi> if not more, ſhould that Province prove <hi>French,</hi> and this is ſufficient for my preſent purpoſe.</p>
               <p>Now let us look abroad, and we ſhall as clearly find, that <hi>Spain</hi> comes into the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſeale. For which way ſoever <hi>France</hi> take, <hi>Spain</hi> muſt take the contrary. Nay in this caſe, <hi>Spain</hi> is as much concerned as <hi>England.</hi> For if <hi>France</hi> have theſe Provinces entirely, how ſhall they alone be able to bring home their <hi>American</hi> Treaſure? They know to their ſorrow, what they have loſt formerly by the <hi>Dutch</hi> taking their Plate-fleets; and what an extraordinary charge and hazard they had to defend them. And ſhall we not then think, that they will rather venture to the utmoſt with the <hi>Engliſh;</hi> than let us intercept their Treaſure, and after ſome years be maſter of their Mines? It is true, if I was led as the world is uſually, to judge by news, which hath been for ſome months that <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>England</hi> are breaking, all this was frivolous; but I make my meaſures from reaſons of State, which tells me, that they will not, becauſe they muſt not, and they muſt not, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is their mutual Intereſt, and it is their Intereſt, becauſe otherwiſe they cannot ballance <hi>France,</hi> but will both in time be ruined. So then you ſee clearly, that upon ſuppoſition that <hi>Holland</hi> be <hi>French,</hi> it will be <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi> againſt <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> and ſo we are again ballanced.</p>
               <p>We are thus far upon ſure grounds, we ſhall now proceed to that which is not much leſs certain, if we rightly conſider. And that is, that <hi>Denmark</hi> in all probability will become alſo our Enemies, if we take <hi>France</hi> ſo far for our Friends, as to make him our Maſter. Let us but well obſerve a few fundamental <hi>Maxims of State,</hi> which every Nation according to their Intereſt frame for their Government, and it will much help us to make a
<pb facs="tcp:56430:27"/>right judgment in all ſuch caſes. Now this is one of that Kingdoms, <hi>Not to ſuffer any one to be abſolute Soveraign of Trade and Navigation if they can poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly prevent it.</hi> For the revenues of that Crown moſtly conſiſting of toll in the <hi>Sound;</hi> we cannot imagine the <hi>Danes</hi> ſuch dullards, but they know who ever is ſo, will ſoon open that paſſage, and make it as free as the water it ſelf between the <hi>North and Baltick Seas.</hi> And then the King may ſit in's houſe at <hi>Gluckstadt,</hi> and take toll of Boats that paſs in the <hi>Elve;</hi> inſtead of <hi>Copenhagen,</hi> and his Caſtle of <hi>Croneberg,</hi> where now he takes toll of all ſhips in the <hi>Sound.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I foreſee it will be ſaid, that <hi>Sweden</hi> will ballance <hi>Denmark,</hi> if that ſhould be ſo. But ſee then what work this <hi>Trade</hi> will make in the world. And this is wholly uncertain: nay, Intereſt will rather incline to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. For though <hi>Sweden</hi> be none of the richeſt in Trade, yet have they their ſhare to loſe as well as the reſt. And the Revenues of that Crown conſiſting much in Copper, (which hath occaſioned their Armies ſpoiling all the Mines of that Metal in <hi>Germany,</hi> and whereſoever they could, on purpoſe to enhance their own) they know very well that pains might have been ſpared, if Commerce ſhould have an abſolute Monarch; and that with all the <hi>Chimiſtry</hi> that they can uſe, they ſhall not be able to extract ſilver and gold out of that Mettal, when one only Chapman comes to the market. Beſides their <hi>Bremiſh</hi> and other Territories on this ſide the <hi>Baltick,</hi> will ſoon lye a bleeding, they know; if <hi>France</hi>'s Sword comes to wound the Roman Eagle, and his race. It may be ſome may ſay the <hi>Dane</hi> dares not for fear of loſing that we are indebted to him. But who knows not that it is better to loſe a part, than the whole. And if blows be a way of paying of debts, we may happily have <hi>Portugal</hi> ſo to pay us.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Having thus ballance the apparent ſtrength of both ſides, we ſhall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to ſome other conſiderations, concerning the ſame. For it is not enough to conſider power abſolutely, but alſo the management thereof; for leſs powers well managed, are uſually prevalent above greater. And herein are many things, which in my judgment, were we an over-match for them, which you ſee is not ſo, would render our ruining their Naval power, and conſequently their Traffick impracticable. As 1. Suppoſing we are under <hi>France,</hi> ſhall their whole Fleet conſtantly be here, and leave the <hi>French</hi> Coaſt naked, or ſhall they from thence come to joyn with us for our Sea expeditions? If the former, <hi>France</hi> is ſubject continually to be mole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted and diverted from <hi>England;</hi> and if the latter to be intercepted, by reaſon of their ſituation. 2. Who ſhall have the direction of Naval Affairs, is to me very conſiderable. Whether the <hi>French</hi> alone, or conjoyntly with the <hi>Dutch;</hi> for that the latter only ſhould be intruſted, is not to be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined. The former way is liable to miſcarry through unskilfulneſs, the latter through jealouſies and diſſentions. 3. Where ſhall Mariners be had for our Fleets? ſhall the <hi>French</hi> preſs here as in their own Kingdom? If ſo, I foreſee, we ſhall ſoon loſe our Sea-men. Or ſhall they only uſe
<pb facs="tcp:56430:27"/>Volunteers? Then their number will be ſmall, becauſe the <hi>French</hi> pay is not great. I might mention other particulars, as the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> Officers diſcord. The manner of payments, and from whence, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But theſe are enow to ſhew us, that which way ſoever we look there's nothing but difficulty and danger ſtares us in the face.</p>
               <p n="4">4. But we have yet that which is more momentous, and that is the ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Great <hi>Britain.</hi> For could we knock their men in the head, as eaſily as our <hi>Borinne</hi>'s their eggs; and ſink their Ships, as if they were ſhells; yet we cannot poſſibly remove the Iſland. Which is,
<list>
                     <item>1. Not only nigh unto us, but over againſt us, ſo that we cannot look out, but we are upon them.</item>
                     <item>2. So ſituated, that ſhould we bear them and their Aſſociates, (which is not eaſie in equal powers) they can ſtill manage a War deſtructive to us. And what good will it do any but the envious, to ruipe others, if they be ruined themſelves? For with a few Ships in the Chanel, wherein they have Harbours all along, to go in and out at pleaſure; they will force us continually to ſail with great Convoys, or we ſhall be forced to fall into their hands. And the like may be ſaid of the Northern paſſage by the <hi>Orcades,</hi> where a few Ships will obſtruct our Trade. Now how great a prejudice this is to Traffick, I leave all knowing men to judge. For by this means. No ſingle Ships, nor ſmall numbers can ſail. Reſtraint will be laid upon going out but in great Fleets, and with ſufficient Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voys. Many will be neceſſitated to lie idle, and at great expences to wait for their Company, whilſt they could ſometimes have performed their voyage. And Merchants loſe particular deſigns, which are uſually the greateſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, to ſuch as are able rightly to manage them.</item>
                     <item>3. In ſtorms and tempeſts we ſhall be frequently forced into their Harbours, and ſo fall as a prey into their mouths.</item>

Whereas <hi>France</hi> being on the Continent, is ſubject to invaſion from <hi>Spain</hi> on ſeveral ſides. Which was one reaſon, why our Anceſtors preferred the guardianſhip of <hi>England,</hi> before that of <hi>France.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>Tangier</hi> in the mouth of the <hi>Streights,</hi> will be no ſmall prejudice to our <hi>Mediterranean</hi> Trade. Which if the mould or harbour can be made firm, will prove of great concernment to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Crown, and a ſtrong curb to all their enemies Traffick. And here I might adde, <hi>Cadiz,</hi> and all the Coaſt of <hi>Spain;</hi> for if we be <hi>French,</hi> no wiſe man (I think) will doubt, but we ſhall have <hi>Spain</hi> our enemies again.</p>
               <p>And theſe things I think are abundantly ſufficient to diſmount our Adverſaries confidence, of carrying away the Trade from <hi>England,</hi> if we ſhould come under the power of <hi>France.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Another grand Argument againſt us is, that we are more likely to enjoy Peace under <hi>France</hi> than <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb facs="tcp:56430:28"/>
               <p>Peace (I confeſs) is an invaluable bleſſing. How many and great miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries doth it free us from! Bloodſhed, violence to our Perſons and Eſtates, unquietneſs, and almoſt all manner of troubles. How many and great mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies doth Peace bring along with it! It is both the mother that bears, and the nurſe that brings up all our temporal bleſſings. It gives us mercies, the freedom of enjoying them, and ſweetens their enjoyment. It contains liberty, plenty, equity, tranquility, pleaſure, and ſafety. So that he was a mad man that ſhould not chuſe Peace. But I fear our coming under <hi>France,</hi> is neither the way to procure Peace, nor the means to preſerve it. And that we by ſo doing, ſhall but have <hi>Ixions</hi> fate in the Fable, embrace a cloudy and tempeſtuous War, inſtead of the fair and beloved <hi>Juno</hi> of Peace.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Let it be conſidered; that if we have Peace by Land, we have War by Sea: which is to leap out of the frying-pan into the fire. It is an old and a good political axiom, <hi>Ex duobus malis minus eſt eligendum;</hi> Theolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gical it was never, for in Divinity, <hi>Nullum malum eſt eligendum.</hi> Now if we rightly meaſure our Intereſt, we ſhall find a Land War much more eligible for us upon many accounts, which I need not here to mention, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing eaſily imagined by all wiſe men. For ſhould it be granted, that for the preſent the two Crowns accord and we have Peace: it will either be ſuch a one as will ruine us, or cannot be laſting to be ſure; but in a very few years will neceſſarily come to the ballance I have mentioned of <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>England</hi> againſt <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Holland.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Let us therefore examine their grounds; that ſo we may ſee before us, and not run our ſelves blindfold into deſtruction. Which ſo far as I can diſcern are theſe four. <hi>The power and prevalency of his Arms. His trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to maintain them. His nearneſs to us. And his Allies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt for the <hi>power and prevalency of his Arms.</hi> 1. It is true his numbers are great, both in Arms and in the Kingdom of <hi>France.</hi> The great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages he hath, by the largeneſs, compactneſs, ſituation, and ſoil of his Dominions; the infinite number of Nobility and Gentry for Cavalry, and the populouſneſs of his Cities and Provinces for Infantry, which cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citate him above all the Princes of <hi>Europe,</hi> to enlarge his Empire; I well know, and willingly grant.</p>
               <p>But what relates to the Kingdom of <hi>France</hi> concerns not us <hi>Netherlanders</hi> in this caſe further than as to his Arms and power to defend us. Now in my reaſon the greater power in the <hi>Soveraign,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Sect. <hi>5.</hi>
                  </note> the leſs liberty in the <hi>Subject,</hi> as we have already ſhown. So that the more numerous his Armies, and ſo much the worſe. Doth not <hi>France</hi> groan under this burden, and ſhall we deſire to do ſo, or help to eaſe them by bearing part thereof on our backs? If we be ſo kind, I dare engage we may have it all, and a thouſand thanks from that Kingdom. Which is ſo wearied with it, that above one half of them (if my intelligence greatly deceive me not) would rejoyce to ſee it leſſened, though it were with ſome loſs to the honour of the Nation. But becauſe I write not to be known, but to better the world, and with
<pb facs="tcp:56430:28"/>my bucket of water to help to quench the Flames, that threaten deſtruction to the Proteſtant Intereſt; I ſhall deſire all intelligent perſons to enquire of thoſe that underſtand <hi>France,</hi> or have come lately thence; and then let them conſider if their condition be deſirable. If a numerous Army lies quartered upon us, ſhall we not both be kept under by them, and eaten up of them? And although they be paid in the Kings name, yet muſt not we find our ſhare of the money? I never yet read or heard of any wiſe people, that deſired their Prince ſo potent, for fear he ſhould oppreſs them. A due Mediocrity hath always been counted beſt. Let any one read the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Roman</hi> Hiſtorians, or any others that are wiſely writ: and he ſhall find, if he duly obſerve, that the <hi>Princes Potency hath always been the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples jealouſie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. It is alſo true, that he hath been ſucceſsful in his Arms againſt us, beyond moſt mens imaginations, and perhaps even his own hopes and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations. But if all things be rightly conſidered, it is no ſuch wonder as the world makes it. Our Wars by Sea; our inteſtine Diviſions; the cowardiſe of ſome; the corruption of many; and our multiplicity of Garriſons, whereby our Forces were ſo parcel'd, that fighting ſeverally they were eaſily vanquiſhed; together wi<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> ſeveral other cauſes which concurr'd under the hand of <hi>Divine Juſtice,</hi> makes it no wonderment to wiſe and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderate men. Nor is it any new thing in the world, but that which hath befallen moſt of the Nations in <hi>Europe,</hi> as all their Hiſtories abundantly witneſs.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Nor will this evince our defence. For it hath often been experiment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that thoſe that have won much in a little time, have loſt it again in leſs. How did the ſame <hi>French</hi> Nation under <hi>Charles</hi> the 8. over-run moſt part of <hi>Italy</hi> in a little time, and quickly loſt it, as the many Hiſtorians of both Nations relate! And in our days, how did the <hi>Swede</hi> like lightning paſs through <hi>Poland;</hi> which was quickly extinct and came to nothing! And ſo may this (if it pleaſe God, and we manage our work wiſely) like a thunderclap and ſudden flaſh of lightning, afright and aſtoniſh us, more than hurt us, as I ſhall ſhew hereafter.</p>
               <p n="4">4. If <hi>France</hi> goes on, the world grows ſo jealous of their greatneſs, that they may poſſible have work enough; when their hand is againſt every one, and every one againſt them; and then where ſhall be our peace and defence? It is known by all that know former times, how in the <hi>Roman</hi> Monarchy when they were diſtreſſed at home, they ſtill called their Forces from abroad, and left their conquered Provinces to ſhift for themſelves, as I might inſtance in <hi>Spain, France, England,</hi> and many others both Eaſtern and Weſtern. And indeed it always is thus; ſo that ſhould <hi>France</hi> be fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len into by <hi>Spain,</hi> or <hi>England,</hi> or the <hi>Empire,</hi> or <hi>Italy,</hi> or other ſeveral of theſe joyntly, or ſhould they fall into Civil Wars, which are more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent there than any, yea I think I may ſay all the Kingdoms in <hi>Europe;</hi> in what condition ſhould we then be? Truly I will tell you, I think fighting
<pb facs="tcp:56430:29"/>with the <hi>French,</hi> and more eager to be rid of them, then many are now to receive them. If any one ſay, but would you have us entertain the <hi>Engliſh?</hi> I ſay no, but preſerve our own freedom by complying with them as I ſhall ſhew hereafter.</p>
               <p n="5">5. If we will eſpouſe all the quarrels of <hi>France</hi> we may poſſibly have more than enow; and ſuch as may prove our ruin, rather than ſafety and ſecurity. Our Marriners have their Wars by Sea, our citizens and Souldiers by Land. Our Merchants Trade to pay their money, and all to raiſe <hi>France</hi> to the univerſal <hi>Monarchy,</hi> to the ruin of the Reformed Religion, and alſo the greateſt part of Chriſtendom. And though now his friends be many, yet if he once comes to receive a check his enemies will be more.</p>
               <p n="6">6. I ſee no need we have to fear all his power and prevalency, if we will do our duty, and quit our ſelves as men for our Country. And if we do, upon our friendſhip with the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> we may have Souldiers enow out of thoſe 3 Kingdoms, which are as good Infantry ſurely as <hi>French,</hi> by their own <hi>Hiſtorians</hi> Confeſſion, and it is <hi>Foot</hi> we want (if any) for the defence of our Garriſons. And beſides that they are not ſo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be remanded, as thoſe of <hi>France;</hi> thoſe Kingdoms being Ilands, leſs liable to invaſion, and leſs likely to be engaged in foreign, or to be invol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in Domeſtick Wars.</p>
               <p>Secondly, for his treaſure, it cannot be denied to be very great. But this is rather againſt, than for our Adverſaries. For <hi>the richer the Soveraign the poorer the ſubject.</hi> And I never knew any people yet, that deſired to have their Prince ſo rich, eſpecially when it comes out of their own pockets. I will not meddle with the diſpute of the <hi>Greeks Oſtraciſme,</hi> nor that of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liticians, whether poverty or riches in the Soveraign be better for the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. A due mean wiſe men have allways accounted beſt. When neither the Prince may be jealous of his people for their <hi>Riches,</hi> nor they of him for his <hi>Treaſures;</hi> but that they may mutually depend on each other, for the good of the whole. For as it is difficult to determin, what the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate may not demand, in caſe of neceſſity; ſo is it eaſie to conclude, that he ought not to impoveriſh his people when there is none, and make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf rich by their ruins. That being tollerable, but this intollerable op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion.</p>
               <p>Nor is it imaginable, that he will make <hi>France</hi> poor, to make us rich. Nor is it credible that if they remain poor, we ſhall remain rich. For in all Princes there remain ſome jealouſies of a conquered people, that they may, upon ſome revolution of affaires or other, revolt. And therefore it is their uſual practice, by all ways poſſible to drain them, and draw their riches home; as the <hi>Romans</hi> into <hi>Italy,</hi> and other Conquerors their own Kingdoms; either by bringing it into their own Treaſuries, or Native ſubjects purſes, or rather both, that ſo they may command it upon all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, for their nearneſs unto us, we know it too well. And if the
<pb facs="tcp:56430:29"/>ſubdued Provinces remain in their hands, ſhall find what it is to have ſuch neighbors. But otherwiſe <hi>England</hi> is nearer us than <hi>France,</hi> and can eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier come to our aſſiſtance. For the <hi>French</hi> have not only a long march, but through part of the Empire, which is their enemie, and ſo liable to obſtruction. As to the Prince of <hi>Liege</hi> (or Archbiſhop of <hi>Colen</hi>) <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Newburg</hi> and others that have permitted this paſſage, they may pay dear enough for it hereafter; as their ſubjects, are paying for it at preſent, even to the <hi>French</hi> themſelves. Who are ſo weary of their Company, that I perſwade my ſelf, they will be the firſt that will endeavour, to drive them out, when they ſhall find an opportunity.</p>
               <p>But we are not affraid of all our Adverſaries weapons, and therefore will enforce their Argument, by ſuppoſing all they can deſire; That <hi>France</hi> will keep theſe conquered Provinces, and in all probability make new acqueſts, by ſubduing of the <hi>Spaniſh Netherlands.</hi> So that if we be not ſubject to him, we ſhall never be at quiet, but they will continually be as Thorns in our ſides.</p>
               <p n="1">1. And why may we not as well ſuppoſe, that if we be under him, we ſhall never be at reſt for others? For no Potentate in Chriſtendom hath more jealous eyes upon him, nor likelier to be continually imployed in Wars. Now what will changing help us, if we better not our condition? For we may eaſily foreſee, that if we come under <hi>France,</hi> we ſhall have <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi> againſt us by Sea (as we have ſaid) and the <hi>Germans</hi> and <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Provinces by Land, and ſo ſhall be in the ſame condition, though not by the ſame enemies, that we are now; ground like Corn betwixt the Mil-ſtones. Yea it is more than probable, that knowing the tickliſh con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition and mutinous temper of the <hi>French</hi> Nation, he will bring his Wars into theſe Countries and their conſines, and ſo we ſhall again become, the Cock-pit of War for all <hi>Europe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. I doubt not but he will attacque the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Provinces and ſeek to connect them with his conqueſts, and then incorporate all with <hi>France.</hi> But it is uncertain what time this may require before they be all under his power. We know not the Articles between the two Crowns, nor are we ſure that <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Auſtria</hi> will ſee this work. Many things may fall out, which no mans eye can foreſee. The King of <hi>France</hi> is mortal and may die, and the <hi>Dauphin</hi> young and ſo uncapable to carry on ſuch mighty deſigns. Or he may meet with a check in his enterpriſes, and be ſtopt in his further progreſs of glory. <hi>France</hi> is harraſt, and weary of Wars, may fall to their former mutinies. The King of <hi>Spain</hi> may grow more potent. <hi>England, Sweden</hi> and the <hi>Cantons</hi> of <hi>Switzerland</hi> may think themſelves con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, as well as the <hi>Empire</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> to ſtop the growing greatneſs of <hi>France.</hi> The <hi>Spaniſh</hi> may divert him in <hi>Catalonia</hi> and elſe where. Sickneſs and mortallity may ſeize upon his Armies. Factions in his court, diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents in the Country, tumults in his Kingdom, and many other Accidents may happen, to call him off us, or at leaſt neceſſitate him to give us rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable
<pb facs="tcp:56430:30"/>conditions, and confine him to his own Kingdom. So that 'tis madneſs to avoid a preſent miſchief, to run our ſelves upon certain ruine.</p>
               <p n="3">3. If we had the friendſhip of <hi>England,</hi> we might ſoon be in a capacity to defend our ſelves againſt <hi>France,</hi> and need not fear the power of their Arms. I do not ſay that we alone are able to recover at preſent what we have loſt, without the aſſiſtance of others: But that theſe remaining Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces are able to defend themſelves, and either let go the other, or in time poſſibly regain them, as we ſhall ſhew hereafter.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, For his <hi>Allies,</hi> they need not fright us. For all friendſhip of the World, and eſpecially publick, proves often times like winter brooks, which run freely when we have leaſt need of them, but fail us in drought when we want their Water. If the fortunes of <hi>France</hi> ſhould once decline, we ſhould ſee thoſe that now adore them, readily renounce this their idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and not only confeſs their former fault, but help to turn the <hi>Wheel</hi> about, and bring them under whom they now exalt.</p>
               <p>And thus we ſee what ſmall grounds there are of enjoying ſuch great Peace under <hi>France,</hi> as our Adverſaries flatter themſelves withal, and would perſwade the World of; which will never find credit with wiſe men, who are uſed to judge by Reaſons of State, and not by the vain ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments of fancy.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The fourth argument for <hi>France</hi> is, their having the <hi>upper Provinces</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, which are of ſuch concernment to the <hi>Nether,</hi> that they affirm we cannot want them, and therefore we muſt call in <hi>France</hi> that he may have them all, that ſo they may be joyned under one <hi>Head.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We cannot want them ſay they.
<list>
                     <item>1. For our <hi>Security,</hi> and</item>
                     <item>2. for our <hi>Commerce.</hi>
                     </item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>Let us therefore examine theſe things, and having ſo done, we ſhall give a releaſe to your patience in this great Argument of our Adverſaries concerning <hi>Trade.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt that we cannot want them for our <hi>Security,</hi> is apparently falſe. Nay upon a <hi>Politick account</hi> we had better part with them, though not in point of <hi>Honour</hi> and <hi>Religion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. They were a continual charge to thoſe inferior <hi>Provinces,</hi> which yet was willingly born, in regard of their being an out Sconſe to us, which many ſuppoſed ſufficiently ſtrong for our defence. Which yet others have always doubted of, and now we find they had ſufficient reaſon. Seeing then ſome of them willingly deſerted us, and others ſlightly defended themſelves, and us conſequently, and thus laid us open to the invaſion of our enemies: if we let them go, and they ſuffer thereby, they may thank themſelves, and we muſt otherwiſe ſecure our Country.</p>
               <p n="2">2. I wonder men ſhould think they can ſecure us, when we ſee the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary by our experience. Nay indeed this was the great miſtake that had like to have ruined us all. For we relying on them, was unprepared for our own defence, whereby the whole was greatly endangered. Yea ſo
<pb facs="tcp:56430:30"/>greatly, that if the <hi>French</hi> had fallen into <hi>Holland,</hi> when they came to <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>trecht,</hi> I tremble to think, what work they might have made amongſt us.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It was apparent that the boundaries of the Common-wealth, was too great, and our Garriſons too many, to defend againſt ſuch powerful Armies. Which at the ſame time are not only Maſters of the Field, but able to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault what Places they pleaſe. This War being far different from our form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er with <hi>Spain</hi> (or leſs Potentates) wherein we had an Army to ballance theirs, for relief of ſuch Garriſons as were at any time attackt by them. And this the <hi>Author</hi> of the <hi>Intereſt of Holland,</hi> hath long ſince well obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and experience now ſhews us. Wherein I dare be his ſecond, againſt any combatants that dare encounter him.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Let any man but recount our Garriſons with their greatneſs, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute what number of men is requiſite for their defence; and he will ſoon ſee, whether I have not clear reaſon on my ſide. I ſhall not now ſtand to do that, though if any be obſtinate, I can do it ſufficiently to convince him: that though the <hi>States</hi> in times of Peace maintain 60000, and in this War above 100000 men by Land; yet were they not half enow to defend all our Garriſons, and keep an Army in the Field to relieve them. And therefore I never expected any better ſucceſs of the War, than now we ſee; though my judgment was entertained by many with merriment, and of others with fears it might prove Prophetical. For we muſt either have diſmantled moſt of the weakeſt, and ſupplied a few of moſt conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence for a ſtrong reſiſtance; or it was never likely it ſhould be otherwiſe than it is; it being always found true by experience, that <hi>multiplicity of weak powers prove none againſt ſtrong,</hi> for <hi>dum ſinguli pugnant, univerſi vincuntur.</hi> And therefore we ſee our enemies, had the wiſdom to wave <hi>Maeſtricht,</hi> that was provided with men to give them work; and fell upon ſuch places, as they either knew their money had, or their Swords could moſt eaſily conquer.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Many of our outmoſt Garriſons lying in a champaign Country, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be relieved, without a powerful Army of Cavalry. And theſe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries are very uncapable many ways both for keeping and marching great numbers of Horſe. In theſe lower Provinces Land being ſo dear, and more profitable for Cows than Horſes; and ſo many great Rivers, which cannot be paſt with Bridges, except we make them of Boats continually, is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient demonſtration that they cannot be here. And in the upper Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces there is not forrage for ſuch a body of Horſe, as we muſt have if we will relieve our outmoſt Garriſons. And this thoſe that know them knows. Let us from <hi>Bergen op Zoom</hi> paſs along the coaſt of <hi>Brabant</hi> by <hi>Breda</hi> and our other Garriſons even as far as <hi>Maeſtricht,</hi> and from thence back to the <hi>Buſs</hi> which is the greateſt part of the open Country we have (for <hi>Gelderland, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>trecht</hi> and <hi>Overiſſel</hi> are full of Rivers) and we ſhall find that which belongs to us, inconſiderable for this purpoſe; the greateſt part of that Country being heath, and barren ground.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:56430:31"/>
               <p>I know well that moſt of the Cities lie upon Rivers, but I know alſo and ſo do all of ordinary underſtanding, that a Fort on either ſide commands them, and ſo bars our paſſage by water to them.</p>
               <p>But let us inſtance in one for all. I wiſh mine adverſaries would ſhew us any way to relieve <hi>Maeſtrecht</hi> if it ſhould be aſſaulted and diſtreſſed by the <hi>French.</hi> I mean that is practicable, for we are not now diſcourſing of <hi>Mathematical powers,</hi> which demonſtrate motions as ſwift as the Sun's, and the plucking up Oaks with a ſingle hair, and ſuch like curioſities that can never be done; but of <hi>Martial powers,</hi> which are not for ſpeculative no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, but practical performances.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Let us but conſider who hath paid thoſe great Armies we have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly kept, and muſt pay many more both Foot, and Horſe (which are much more chargeable) that we muſt keep, if we will defend theſe out-Provinces againſt powerful enemies; and we ſhall ſoon ſee that we muſt pay very dear for their uncertain and weak defence of us. For this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe I ſhall ſatisfie the curious with inſerting the proportion of Taxes which each Province pays to the Publick for the Armies and other expences: whereby it will appear that the <hi>quota</hi> of theſe ſuperior Provinces, <hi>Gelder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, Over-Iſſel,</hi> and <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>trecht</hi> (which the <hi>French</hi> now poſſeſs) is very incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable, wherein alſo they have often been behind, and will be much leſs able now to pay it, being ſo much impoveriſhed.</p>

               <p n="7">7. If they be regained, we muſt pay for it, they being now under our enemies. And what an infinite of blood and treaſure that will coſt, if our enemy will not quit them on reaſonable terms in treaty, I leave any man to judge.</p>
               <p n="8">8. If we rightly conſider, great Territories are for Kings, ſmall only fit for Common-wealths. This we may obſerve in the Hiſtories of former times, in the <hi>Grecian</hi> Republicks and their neighbour Kingdoms. For the <hi>Roman</hi> was mixt of <hi>Monarchy</hi> and <hi>Ariſtocracy,</hi> by the great power of their <hi>Conſuls</hi> ruling as Monarchs by their turns, and eſpecially in dangers by <hi>Dictators.</hi> Yea our own experience hath ſhown us this in the neighbou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Kingdoms. But what ſhall I ſay, many men are like the Judges Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues at <hi>Thebes;</hi> have their eyes blinded and hands lamed, though not for Juſtice but for judgment, they can neither ſee nor feel before them. In 59 being then in <hi>England,</hi> in ſome Gentlemens Company, where there were ſome zealous Republicans, and I from Hiſtory and obſervation
<pb facs="tcp:56430:31"/>ſhewing them, that in great Dominions, eſpecially, where there are many Nobility, a Common-wealth could never ſtand long, that if there, it muſt be from the City of <hi>London</hi> managing it as <hi>Rome</hi> had done, and not as they went to work, and ſeveral other things, ſhewing the impracticableneſs of their notions, (which I have reaſon to remember, for I was complained of to <hi>Lambert,</hi> and was in danger of being called before the <hi>Council of State</hi>) In the year 60. ſome of them took me for half a Prophet, and ſo perhaps may ſome hereafter, for what I ſhall now ſay: <hi>That if we affect great Terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories by Land we ſhall loſe all.</hi> It is our Sea affairs, that we are ſet for by our Country, made for by our genious, and fit for eſpecially, by our im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment. And we may as well think to turn our Rivers, as change theſe things, nay, indeed, if we could, it would quickly turn to our deſtruction: Traffick by Sea, as I formerly have ſhown, being our chief ſecular intereſt.</p>
               <p>But I foreſee what will here be ſaid, that a weak defence is better than none, and how all theſe <hi>Inferior Provinces</hi> be otherwiſe ſecured.</p>
               <p>And it is very true indeed, <hi>better a weak wall, than none at all.</hi> And if we could not build a ſtronger, and at leſs charges, and with far leſs coſt for repa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration and defence againſt the violent ſtorms of our Enemies, (for none can ſecure us againſt Heaven) we ſhould be aſhamed to have thrown down the old, which (in my judgment) is by the former Conſiderations levelled with the ground. For as it is folly to pull down before we conſider how to build better, ſo we muſt take heed that therein we commit not thoſe errors which many wiſe men (though that was none of their wiſdom) have fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently (as I have often obſerved) fallen into in their building, <hi>To beſtow as much in piecing and patching an old houſe, as would build a new one far ſtronger and better: and when they have built either old or new, to find ſeveral inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encies therein, which a provident fore-ſight might have prevented.</hi> As the ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Mathematician Dr. <hi>Wren</hi> hath demonſtrated (as I hear) in <hi>England,</hi> that they had better build S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s in <hi>London</hi> anew, than repair the old. So I think I am able to demonſtrate, that we had better make a new defence for theſe inferior Provinces, than that of the ſuperior. But it muſt be well conſidered of l<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſt we find inconveniences therein afterwards. And as in <hi>Architecture</hi> I pleaſantly play with dice and cards alone (which others do in company) making my walls of the former, and floors and covering of the latter, to ſee the conven<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ences and inconveniences therein, better than in plain figures; and eſpecially to demonſtrate the ſame to others that will adviſe with me therein, and are no Mathematicians: ſo here I muſt confeſs I have ſeriouſly palled down and ſet up ſeveral defences for us, which are too long to relate. But I will briefly touch of ſome things, which are ſufficient (I think) to ſilence mine Adverſaries.</p>
               <p>There are 5 or ſix ways of Natural Fortification and defence of a Country.</p>
               <p>Seas for Iſlands, which are the beſt. For though they are thereby incapacitated to enlarge their Empire abroad, being by the Sea as it were confined to home, yet have they great advantages thereby, not only of
<pb facs="tcp:56430:32"/>Maritime Negotiation, but alſo ſecurity from Invaſion. So that they are at ſmall charges for maintaining Armies; which thoſe that live on Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nents, muſt conſtantly do for their defence: otherwiſe the door ſtands open for the firſt that comes, to enter in and take poſſeſſion.</p>
               <p>Great Mountains that are unpaſſible for Armies, or ſuch paſſes as the famous <hi>Thermopyles,</hi> which are eaſily defended, and theſe are next to Seas the beſt defence.</p>
               <p>Vaſt Wilderneſſes where Armies can have no Proviſion to march, but what they carry along with them, as in <hi>Africa.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Peninſular Countries, which are eaſily retrencht within lines of ſecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as the famous Wall in the North of <hi>England,</hi> firſt made by <hi>Agricola, Nero</hi>'s General there, repaired by <hi>Hadrian,</hi> and after by <hi>Severus</hi> againſt the <hi>Picts,</hi> the ruines whereof are ſtill apparent. And <hi>Scotland</hi> often alſo againſt <hi>England</hi> hath thus retrencht themſelves, even in our days with great ſafety againſt the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Army; which if they had had the wiſdom to have kept within, they had ſaved themſelves and the Kingdom: but their adventurous folly in forſaking them, was dearly paid for by the loſs of both.</p>
               <p>Great Rivers which cannot eaſily be paſt. As <hi>Euphrates</hi> in the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> and the <hi>Rhyne</hi> in the <hi>Weſt,</hi> defended thoſe Nations beyond them, from the great power of the <hi>Romans.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And laſtly inundations by Water, mariſh and boggy grounds, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I might be large in examples of all theſe in ſeveral Kingdoms of the World; and alſo in the wonderful Providence of God, who hereby ſets bounds and limits to the mighty <hi>Nimrod</hi>'s of the World, ſaying unto them by the voice of Nature as to the great Seas and Waters, <hi>hitherto ſhall ye go and no further:</hi> but I will confine my ſelf to our own Country.</p>
               <p>Now theſe Provinces if we conſider them aright, are naturally fortified moſt of theſe ways. Not by Mountains, for we live in a level Country; nor by Deſarts and barren Wilderneſſes, for we have a fruitful Land, like <hi>Canaan</hi> flowing with milk and honey. But all the other ways we are defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible; ſo that if we can but defend our ſelves by Sea, and keep that for our Commerce; we need not fear all our Enemies by Land. We have the Sea to guard us below, mighty Rivers not only within, but on both ſides theſe Provinces to defend us: we are either Iſlands as <hi>Zeeland;</hi> or Penin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſular as <hi>Frieſland</hi> and <hi>Groeningen</hi> together, and <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>trecht,</hi> by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the Sea and great Rivers that almoſt ſurround them. And let it come to the utmoſt extremity, we can by Water drown our Enemies, and ſave our ſelves in our Cities. So that they that talk of conquering us, muſt either be fools, or ignorant of the Country: and thoſe that fear to be conquered, puſillanimous and frighted with vain bravadoes.</p>
               <p>But we will be a little more particular, in running over brieſly the ſeveral Provinces.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Zeeland</hi> conſiſting wholly of Iſlands, is thereby well fortified, and the
<pb facs="tcp:56430:32"/>Inhabitants ſo uſed to the Water, that they are not eaſily maſtered therein.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Frieſland</hi> and <hi>Groningen</hi> together, are almoſt ſurrounded with the <hi>North</hi> and <hi>South</hi> Seas, together with the River <hi>Emes,</hi> and ſcarce acceſſible by Land in regard of the mariſh or boggy grounds, if <hi>Coeverden</hi> and ſome other ſtrong places on the paſſes be kept.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Holland</hi> will prove the greateſt difficulty, and of moſt conſequence; that Province being the Head and Heart of this Republick. For this end I muſt ſuppoſe that we muſt have part of the Province of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>trecht,</hi> which we muſt either regain by Treaty, or by ſtrength, let it coſt what it will, both for our communication, and future ſafety. And then we have theſe two again almoſt environed with the <hi>North</hi> and <hi>South Seas</hi> and ſeveral branches of the <hi>Rhyme</hi> and <hi>Maes.</hi> Only one neck of ground between the <hi>Leck</hi> and <hi>South Sea</hi> of 5 or 6 miles, where a River might be cut to carry water from the former, as ſomething higher, into the latter: from between <hi>Viana</hi> and <hi>Twael,</hi> from whence downwards the River is deep, and hath the Tyde flowing up, by <hi>Houten, Heer, Melis waert, Melaeten,</hi> and ſo along the low grounds to <hi>Pynenborch</hi> into the R<gap reason="illegible" extent="4 letters">
                     <desc>••••</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>Eem</hi> to the <hi>South Sea.</hi> Which will make the whole adjacent Country being low, ſtagnate with water, and ſo defend theſe two Provinces from their enemies incurſions. And the reſt are done to our hands, by the ſeveral foldings of the Arms of thoſe two great Rivers, the <hi>Rhyne</hi> and the <hi>Maſe,</hi> whoſe ſeveral denominations I need not mention, nor the places where, theſe being ſufficiently known to thoſe that know theſe Countries.</p>
               <p>But oh <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>trecht! <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>trecht!</hi> I foreſee there will ſo much depend upon that one City, that I fear the greateſt Affairs of <hi>Europe</hi> will hang, and turn upon that ſingle hinge. I know we flatter our ſelves they will part with it, and I wiſh we may not be deceived; but I fear far other things, not ſo much from what I have ſaid, as from other reaſons of State. But if any will ask what thoſe are: I ſay <hi>Ho-la,</hi> I am ſo far from publiſhing them, that if the ſhirt on my back knew the thoughts of my heart herein, it ſhould be my firſt work to burn it.</p>
               <p>But our Adverſaries will fight it out to the ſtumps both of their ſtrength and weapons. They ſay the <hi>French</hi> in the Superior Provinces hath the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of our <hi>Rivers,</hi> and ſo will be able to ruine our <hi>Trade.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Truly I am tired with this long diſcourſe of Trade, and therefore for a divertiſement I will tell you a ſhort and pleaſant ſtory. Upon a time King <hi>James</hi> of Great <hi>Britain,</hi> was angry with the City of <hi>London,</hi> and ſent for ſome of the Aldermen and Common Council, whom he firſt chid, and then threatned that he would take away their <hi>Charters,</hi> ſpoil them of their Priviledges, and ruine the City, that he would. An old Fox that ſtood behind, perceiving the King in a paſſion, and the reſt of the <hi>Ruffs</hi> in a ſilent fright, pretended deafneſs; and induſtriouſly that his Majeſty might obſerve him, enquired firſt of one and then of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; <hi>What ſays his Majeſty? what? Doth he ſay he will turn the River of
<pb facs="tcp:56430:33"/>Thames?</hi> The King perceiving it, would needs know what he ſaid, and being told, burſt out into laughter, and ſwore in his Scottiſh dialect he was a <hi>fauſe loune,</hi> and packt them away. So let me merrily ask mine Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries one after another, what? will the King of <hi>France</hi> turn the <hi>Rhyne?</hi> will he turn the <hi>Maes?</hi> Will he cut off the arms of thoſe mighty Rivers? Or will he riveletiſe them into more hundred furrows than Hiſtorians tell us <hi>Cyrus</hi> did <hi>Gyndes</hi> when he went to take <hi>Babylon?</hi> Will he chaſtiſe the South Sea, and fetter it, as <hi>Xerxes</hi> did the <hi>Helleſpont,</hi> making <hi>Harderwick</hi> and <hi>Hoorne</hi> as <hi>S<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ſtus</hi> and <hi>Abydus</hi> of old, now the ſtrong Caſtles the <hi>Turks</hi> have made in the <hi>Dardanels?</hi> Let the old rich Merchants that have more money to loſe than I, fear that, I do not. And except he can, ſo long as we keep the mouth of the Rivers where they exonorate themſelves into the Sea; let the <hi>French</hi> keep them above, and ſee what they can make of them.</p>
               <p>But to be ſerious. I had thought our Trading had been in Ships at Sea eſpecially, and not with Boats in Rivers. And that it is theſe inferior Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces, and our Sea Traſſick that <hi>France</hi> aims at; though in regard of our Naval ſtrength, he comes do<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> upon us by Land; thinking that way to carry the Country. For his <gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>pping the Boats paſſing up and down the <hi>Rhine</hi> and <hi>Maes,</hi> there is no fear if we rightly conſider, that that will ruine the <hi>French</hi> themſelves more than us. In regard we can ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt without this, and they cannot. We have Corn in abundance from <hi>Dantſick</hi> and other places, with which we ſupply others in want: but they muſt have theirs from above, by theſe Rivers. How can we think that he ſhould ſtop the Commerce betwixt <hi>Germany</hi> and theſe Countries by the <hi>Rhyne;</hi> and they not ſtop his Proviſions at <hi>Colen</hi> and other places? Or that he intercept the Traffick by the <hi>Maes;</hi> and <hi>Leige,</hi> or at leaſt <hi>Namurs</hi> under the <hi>Spaniſh,</hi> ſhould not prohibit his ſupplies from <hi>France?</hi> There are two ways of dealing with Enemies. If ſmall to beat them, if great to pine them. They dare not but leave a conſiderable Army in thoſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces, for fear of the former; and they muſt be ſupplied from abroad, for fear of the latter. Now if they be not from us beneath, they muſt be by theſe from above; for thoſe Provinces alone are not able to provide for them; and why then ſhould we trouble our ſelves with ſuch fantaſtical fears? Were it not that I thought theſe things ſufficient, and that I have been already ſo prolix in this Argument; I would ſhew at large that thoſe above depend on us for our Money and Commodities, more than we on them for theirs. But to do this ſatisfactorily, would be a large diſcourſe, and therefore I diſmiſs it, at leaſt for the preſent.</p>
               <p>Our Adverſaries having thus ſpent their Cannon upon us ineffectually, will needs try a Volly of ſmall ſhot: That we muſt have theſe out-Provinces, for the quartering our Army, that ſo our Cities may be free from their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbance in Trade.</p>
               <p>But this reaches us not. For we have out-Garriſons enow upon the Conſines of theſe inferior Provinces, as <hi>Sluys, Bergen op Zoom, Breda,
<pb facs="tcp:56430:33"/>Buſs, &amp;c.</hi> well known, that are of leſs Trade, and capable to quarter 100000 men if need was, as I can eaſily make apparent. Nor do I imagine Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers prejudicial to any trading City, if they be not too numerous; but rather helpful, by the Exciſe they pay, the work when off the watch they cheaply perform, the ſpending their money with the poorer ſort, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral other ways which might be mentioned.</p>
               <p>And thus you ſee in point of profit, or worldly Intereſt, that we can want the ſuperior Provinces, (excepting the City of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>trecht,</hi> and a little of the Circumjacent Country) yea had better quit them upon ſeveral accounts; and though our boundaries be leſs, yet if we be more compact and ſtronger, that will abundantly compenſate our greatneſs: beſides the vaſt expence which is ſpared thereby, not only of blood, but treaſure, in maintaining conſtantly ſo great an Army as we muſt, if we will recover and defend them. The only advantage that I can foreſee by them is, to have bad neighbours further off: but whether that will Countervail the coſt, may be a queſtion to others, but is none to me.</p>
               <p>But if we value our honour at ſo high a rate, and will pay ſo dear for it, that if the <hi>French</hi> will not part with them upon fair terms, we will wage war for them; I heartily wiſh we never repent it. For I have obſerved <hi>that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealths are fitter for ſelf defence, and Kingdoms for conqueſts.</hi> Which is ſhaddowed out by the <hi>Venetian</hi> Statue, holding a Shield in the right hand: that ſome unskilful Travellers condemn, as an error in the Statuary. Whoſe yet ambitious ſwerving from this Common-wealths maxim, coſt them very dear: and ſeeing it is the neareſt parallel to our caſe I know, I ſhall briefly relate it, becauſe I think it may be uſeful for us. The <hi>Venetians</hi> having long warred with the <hi>Genoneſe</hi> at Sea, afterwards caſt an ambitious eye on the Continent of <hi>Italy,</hi> and by one means or other (too long to relate) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came Maſters of many conſiderable places. This made them envied by their neighbouring Monarchs, who entred at <hi>Cambray</hi> A. 1508. into a league to war againſt them. <hi>Maximilian</hi> the Emperor, firſt of that name, recovered <hi>Padua, Vineentia, Verona, &amp;c.</hi> belonging to the Empire: the <hi>Pope Ravenna, Cernia, Ariminum</hi> and <hi>Faventia: Lewis</hi> the 12. then poſſeſt of <hi>Millain</hi> in right thereof, <hi>Bergamum, Crema, Cremona</hi> and <hi>Brixia: Ferdinand</hi> the King of <hi>Spain</hi> in right of <hi>Naples, Manfredonia, Trano, Barlet</hi> and <hi>Manopoli,</hi> all of them Havens on the <hi>Adriatick:</hi> the Duke of <hi>Ferrara, Rovigo:</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Mantua, Aſula:</hi> in ſo much that the <hi>Venetians</hi> were forced to betake themſelves to the <hi>Iſlands</hi> and Mariſhes of their City. And yet in a ſhort time by compliance with the <hi>Pope,</hi> they broke the confederacy, and by one means or other regained the reſt, except thoſe belonging to the Realm of <hi>Naples.</hi> The queſtion is debated in the Senate, <hi>whether they ſhould war for theſe or no?</hi> And wiſely concluded in the negative, <hi>That although they were commodious Havens for them, yet better to part with them, than war with ſuch a potent Prince as Spain.</hi> And let me ſay it freely of our ſelves, that had we ſerved God, followed our Trade, and kept our ſelves
<pb facs="tcp:56430:34"/>more off the Stage of <hi>Honour,</hi> as our Anceſtors did: We had leſs occaſioned our neighbours envy, and not been reduced to thoſe Strates we are in.</p>
               <p>But if our Senators be of <hi>Naſica</hi>'s judgement, and would have this foil for our <hi>Martial valour,</hi> and this exerciſe to rub of the ruſt, our Arms have contracted by their long reſt. If our Cavalry are ambitious to have the Trumpet of Fame ſound their praiſes, and the Infantry to have their marches beaten, through ſucceeding Ages and Generations. I wiſh that the eccho of Fame may follow them, with a clearer ſound than the hoarſe clamour of the People; and hope that the imbellick Bores that are ready to ſtart at the report of a Gun, and ſtoop at the whiſtling of a Bullet, may, by having dangers familiarized to them, become (as the Fox did with the Lion) undaunted at laſt, and under their brave General and Commanders regain our reputation; and ſhall heartily pray both for our Senators proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and Souldiers ſucceſs.</p>
               <p>The only conſideration that ſways with me for conteſting for them, if we cannot have them otherwiſe, is that of <hi>Religion.</hi> If therefore this po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy, I have pleaded ſhould prove Apocryphal; and that our League and Alliance with them, obliges us for them recovery; or that the rules of Chriſtian Charity require us, to adventure our own loſs for their ſafety: God forbid that I, or a any man elſe ſhould be againſt it; and I hope there are none ſo degenerate, but will contribute their beſt aſſiſtance both in purſe and perſon to ſo good a work. If the <hi>Turks</hi> will redeem the caged birds to ſet them at liberty, let us much more willingly our Chriſtian Brethren, and ſo committing our cauſe to God, paſs thorow the <hi>Temple of Vertue,</hi> that we may happily come to that of <hi>Honour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Having thus ſhewn the impregnableneſs of the truth of our cauſe, againſt the aſſaults of its Adverſaries; and fought it out with them, in their repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting the <hi>Advantages of being under France, and diſadvantages of being under England,</hi> and our Replying: It comes now to our turn to be <hi>Aſſailants,</hi> wherein we hope to obtain an abſolute conqueſt, by ſhewing them the quite contrary.</p>
               <p>Now herein we might be very large, if we would argue from all the <hi>ſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſory</hi> and <hi>diſſuaſory topicks;</hi> as the <hi>Honeſty</hi> of being under <hi>England</hi> rather than <hi>France</hi> for the common Intereſt of the Proteſtant Religion; the <hi>Hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rableneſs</hi> thereof for the common good of Chriſtendom, whoſe Intereſt it is to oppoſe the greatneſs of <hi>France,</hi> as we ſhall ſhew hereafter: the <hi>Equity</hi> of this for aſſiſting our <hi>Allies</hi> againſt <hi>France:</hi> the <hi>poſſibility</hi> or practicable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of this only, now that his <hi>Highneſs</hi> is both <hi>General</hi> and <hi>Stadt-holder:</hi> and alſo from the contrary of theſe if we ſeek to come under <hi>France.</hi> But we ſhall only inſiſt upon that of <hi>

                  <head>The diſadvantages of being under <hi>France,</hi> and advantages of being under <hi>England.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p n="1">1. Our being under <hi>France</hi> brings us infallibly unto a War with <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> in ſome ſhort time at leaſt, if not preſently, as we have already ſhown. Now how deſtructive ſuch a War is to our maritime Negotiation, I leave all wiſe men to judge, and Merchants eſpcially who have the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience thereof.</p>
                  <p>Whereas on the contrary our being under <hi>England,</hi> gives us <hi>Peace</hi> and freedom of Trade <hi>by Sea;</hi> at leaſt inconſiderable diſturbance in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; yea very probably by <hi>Land</hi> alſo; in regard we can ſpoil <hi>France</hi>'s Trade, diſturb his coaſts, divert his deſigns, and ballacne his power. For <hi>France</hi> cannot fight with all Europe. If we be under <hi>England,</hi> we have <hi>Spain,</hi> the Empire &amp;c. with us: and if <hi>France</hi> will fight, we need not fear him. But if that which is ſaid be not ſufficient (as I ſuppoſe it is) I am ready to make it apparent, that a Land War is more eligible for this Republick, then one by Sea with ſuch potent enemies, and take the utmoſt interruption <hi>France</hi> can make of our Sea-traffick into the ballance.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. If we come under <hi>France</hi> we ſhall either do it <hi>entirely,</hi> or <hi>partially.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If the former we are ruined in a great meaſure in our Commerce, for ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing that the <hi>Spaniſh Netherlands</hi> fall under <hi>France</hi> alſo, as in all proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility they will, and that ſpeedily, as even our Adverſaries themſelves take it for granted; the <hi>Scheld</hi> will be open and free, and ſo <hi>Antwerp, Bruxels, Mechlin, Loven, Lier</hi> and the other Cities of <hi>Brabant,</hi> by this means recover part of their former Commerce; which now we deprive them of by <hi>Vliſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing</hi> and <hi>Rammekens</hi> below, and <hi>Lillo</hi> above on that River: and <hi>Ghant, Cortrick, Riiſſel</hi> and other Cities of <hi>Flanders</hi> a part, by the former River being free, and by opening the other paſſage to them, which is now ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed at the <hi>Sas van Ghant.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now of how great conſequence this is to us, eſpecially in regard of <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> which bears now a double proportion in the Admiralties, and almoſt the half of the burden of the Taxes of <hi>Holland,</hi> which is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt the half of the whole Republick, I leave any one to judge, and eſpecially thoſe that know the principles of intereſt for that great and flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing City. I could be very large upon this, in ſhewing how the fall of <hi>Antwerp</hi> was the riſe of <hi>Amſterdam;</hi> how this City prevailed that the other ſhould not be taken by the Arms of this Republick; as alſo what ſome ſay it coſt them to prevent it; that this was a great inducement to the States, not to enlarge the Republick on the ſide of <hi>Flanders</hi> and <hi>Brabant;</hi> and what a great motive it was to make peace with <hi>Spain,</hi> that ſo they might prevent ſo Potent a Prince as <hi>France,</hi> from coming ſo nigh them upon that quarter, and doing it by power, and how <hi>Holland</hi> gave ſecurity for maintaining the peace, when <hi>Zeeland</hi> proteſted againſt the ſame: But theſe are ſo well known in <hi>Holland,</hi> and the objections againſt it ſo anſwered,<note place="margin">Schookius de Pace.</note>, that I need not lanch into this <hi>Ocean.</hi> Now who is ſo purblind but he may
<pb facs="tcp:56430:35"/>foreſee, that if we come under <hi>France,</hi> the <hi>Flemiſh</hi> Merchants, eſpecially Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts, will return and carry their Trade to <hi>Antwerp,</hi> and many <hi>French</hi> alſo ſetle themſelves there; the River being much better, the City fit for traffick every way, and having the Popiſh Religion publickly profeſt, ſo that it will ſoon conteſt with <hi>Amſterdam</hi> for Trade, and carry it ere long; and then <hi>Amſterdam</hi> may ſay of <hi>Antwerp,</hi> as the Ice of the Water, <hi>Mater me genuit, mater mox gigniture exme.</hi> For we muſt think thoſe Cities, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly <hi>Antwerp,</hi> are nearer the Confines of <hi>France</hi> than <hi>Holland;</hi> and will be more confided in, being Papiſts; ſo that they will become both the care and Crown of that King and Kingdom, for their Trade in theſe Northern parts of the World. Yea let me ſay it, for I know it to be true, this is that the Trading <hi>Flamens</hi> long for, ſeek for, and ſhould above all things be glad to ſee: ſo that in ſtead of hindring, they ſhall help, all they dare, <hi>Frances</hi> conqueſt for this their Intereſt.</p>
                  <p>And if ſome of theſe Provinces only come under <hi>France,</hi> and otherſome under <hi>England;</hi> what a miſerable condition ſhall we be in; by having two ſuch potent Princes continually conteſting in the midſt of us, ſo that by ſuch ſtrong fits of Colick in our bowels, and Convulſions in the whole body, our diſeaſe muſt needs become mortal, and our wounds incurable. Let us ſuppoſe that which is likelieſt, both by the beſt intelligence, incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the people (as we have ſaid formerly) and intereſt as we ſhall ſhew hereaſter, that <hi>Zeeland</hi> become <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> ſhould chuſe <hi>France;</hi> and conſider the ſituation of <hi>Zeeland,</hi> neer the Sea, and allmoſt right over the River of <hi>Thames,</hi> and both between <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> and betwixt <hi>Holland</hi> and the Chanel; the Harbours of <hi>Vliſſing</hi> and <hi>Ter Vere,</hi> into which, the latter eſpecially, all Winter long, no withſtanding the <hi>Ice,</hi> is ſafe arrival; their genious as well as commodiouſneſs to Cape: and then judge in what a perilous condition the Trade of <hi>Holland</hi> will be under <hi>France,</hi> and what miſerable work will be made amongſt us. Or let it be ſuppoſed that there is frendſhip between <hi>France</hi> and <hi>England</hi> in the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their ſeveral ſhares (for we will grant all poſſibilities, and much more probabilities, our Adverſaries can reaſonably deſire) and how will our mutual traffick be ſpoiled, by the impoſitions of both Crowns upon commodities; if we ſhould pay to the one in <hi>Holland</hi> and the other in <hi>Zee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> as undoubtedly we muſt. For it is a certain truth, <hi>that multiplicity of impoſitions, eſpecially when great, ſpoils merchandiſe.</hi> And will it not be in <hi>Englands</hi> power, to open the River, and make it tree for <hi>Antwerp, &amp;c.</hi> as we have ſaid? and in that caſe, where will the vaſt Commerce of <hi>Holland</hi> then be?</p>
                  <p>Whereas on the contrary were we either of theſe ways under <hi>England,</hi> we exclude <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Flanders,</hi> and preſerve our Trade to our ſelves.</p>
                  <p>If we be entirely under <hi>England;</hi> we may ſave the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Netherlands, whoſe Governors are contented with what Commerce they have, rather than loſe all; we may preſerve our ſelves from the <hi>French</hi> neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood;
<pb facs="tcp:56430:35"/>and thereby alſo our Trade from them both.</p>
                  <p>Or if we be but in part ſo; we preſerve the friendſhip of theſe Provinces, the Trade betwixt us, ſecure our intereſt both at home and abroad, and command the Commerce of <hi>Europe</hi> at our pleaſure.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. If we come under <hi>France,</hi> we have not only <hi>Spain</hi> our Enemy by Sea and Land (as we have ſhewn) but the loſs of our <hi>Spaniſh Trade,</hi> and the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarding of our whole <hi>Levant Traffick:</hi> And if we rightly calculate, that amounts to no ſmall part of our Commerce. The <hi>Spaniſh Netherlands, Spain,</hi> and their Dominions in <hi>Italy,</hi> taking off much of our <hi>Eaſt India</hi> and <hi>Weſtern-wares.</hi> For as <hi>Muſcovy</hi> and the other <hi>Nothern Nations</hi> conſume much of our <hi>Pepper,</hi> and ſome hotter Spices, ſo the <hi>Southern,</hi> and <hi>Eaſtern</hi> in the <hi>Mediterranean,</hi> much of our other Commodities. Now with what ſecurity can we either carry them through the Sea, or bring our <hi>Silks, Camels-hair,</hi> and other of the richeſt Commodities we have, from <hi>Aleppo, Egypt,</hi> and our other <hi>Factories</hi> for the <hi>Turkie Trade,</hi> and maintain our Traffick with <hi>Venice, Leghorne,</hi> and other places in <hi>Italy:</hi> Seeing the <hi>Spaniards</hi> beſides the ports of <hi>Spain,</hi> have ſo many <hi>Havens,</hi> and ſome <hi>Iſlands</hi> in the <hi>Adriatick; Sicilia, Sardinia, Majorca</hi> and <hi>Minorea</hi> in the <hi>Midland Sea;</hi> and <hi>Cadiz</hi> ſo commodiouſly ſituated at the mouth of the <hi>Straits;</hi> ſome of which have been famous in all Ages for the Archeſt <hi>Pirates</hi> in the whole World. Betwixt theſe therefore and the <hi>Turks,</hi> we are certain of nothing, but of bad <hi>Trading,</hi> and they good <hi>Caping.</hi> So that I may conclude with the <hi>Poetical Proverb,</hi> that he that deſires to flie from <hi>England,</hi> and fall under <hi>France</hi> for Traffick, <hi>Incidit in Scyllam, cupiens vitare Charybdim.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Whereas on the contrary, if we come under <hi>England;</hi> we certainly ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure our Commerce with <hi>Spain,</hi> and all the <hi>Territories</hi> belonging to that <hi>Crown.</hi> And not only ſo, but againſt the <hi>Turkiſh Pyrates</hi> which infeſt thoſe Seas, which would be of no ſmall advantage to us. For beſides that <hi>England</hi> is at peace with ſome of thoſe places on the <hi>African Coaſt,</hi> and is in friendſhip with the <hi>Turkiſh Empire;</hi> how eaſie a thing was it for us joyntly, to bring the reſt to our own terms? Yea, ſo to ſubdue them all, and keep them under, that they ſhould never be able to diſturb us, no nor <hi>Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> more by their <hi>Caping?</hi> And how generous a deſign this is and how deſtructive to that great and common Enemy of all <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> I leave all wiſe men, and well-wiſhers to Chriſtianity to conſider and judge.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Our <hi>Eaſt India</hi> Trade, the richeſt jewel of this Republick, which hath occaſioned us ſo much envy, and cauſed ſo many quarrels and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſts; if we come under <hi>France,</hi> will run a great <hi>Risks</hi> to be ruined. Hath not this been their great deſign of late years? Have they not for this end erected a <hi>Company?</hi> And now got footing there, and follow it further, even in this laſt year, as we hear, with their greateſt endeavours? Nay, is not this the principal motive, which induces them to make this War? I know we need not fear them there, nor all <hi>Europe</hi> if we have peace here, and can ſend them ſupplies; We are ſo far advanced in that Negotiation;
<pb facs="tcp:56430:36"/>ſo ſtrong in Forts, Shipping and Souldiers; our men ſo accuſtomed to the heat of thoſe Countries; our Mariners to thoſe Coaſts; and Merchants to the Languages and Trade of thoſe parts. But if we come under <hi>France,</hi> will not <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi> ſeek continually to intercep our ſupplies thither, and our Returns from thence? Will not this put us to vaſt Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of Convoys to defend our Ships going and coming in ſecurity? Will not ſome through ſtorms and other accidents when ſeparated, unavoida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly fall into their hands, as we have often experienced? And will they not always be in one hazard or other from them for ſafety? Yea let us ſuppoſe that all ſtands well there, and none of our Ships miſcarry through our Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, but ſafely Arrive both there and here; where ſhall we vent thoſe Commodities from thence at the prices they now yield us; when we have ſuch Enemies at home, and ſuch dangers in carrying them abroad, as we have formerly ſhown? Nay, can we rationally think otherwiſe, than that the Kingdom of <hi>France</hi> will have ſhare with us there, and the Crown the greateſt profit here? So that our <hi>Eaſt India Actions,</hi> as high as they are now may in a little time come as low as thoſe of the <hi>Weſt India Company;</hi> which was once thought equal with the other, and are now next to nothing: and then many of us, who have moſt of our eſtates adventured in the <hi>Eaſt-Indies</hi> Trade, may loſe that we have leſt, as we have formerly loſt by the <hi>Weſt-Indies;</hi> and no remedy but patience, for we muſt ſit down in a ſorrowful filence. Herein I have reaſon to ſpeak feelingly of my fears, being ſo concern'd according to the proportion of my ſmall eſtate; how much, mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters none but my ſelf, but were it ten times more, I muſt tell you; that though the <hi>Actions</hi> at this preſent are conſiderably above three hundred, I ſhall the firſt day I ſee we come under <hi>France,</hi> ſell mine willingly for two, rather than keep them, and render many thanks to the buyer into the bargain.</p>
                  <p>Whereas on the other hand if we come under <hi>England,</hi> they have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly had, and ſtill have a conſiderable ſhare in the <hi>Eaſt India Trade.</hi> Their <hi>Company</hi> and ours accord well, and frequently accommodate each others correſpondence. His Majeſty in the former War, in his Declaration, and the Papers paſt between the <hi>States General,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>A.D.</hi> 1664, 1665</note> and his Envoy Sir <hi>George Dawn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> infiſts upon <hi>Poleron</hi> one of the <hi>Banda Iſlands,</hi> ſatisfaction for injuries paſt, with deduction of what we had ſuffered, and regulation of Trade for the future;<note place="margin">
                        <hi>A.D.</hi> 1671/2</note> and his <hi>Majeſty</hi> in his <hi>Declaration</hi> of this preſent War only men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions the laſt, <hi>The Regulation of Trade in the Eaſt-Indies.</hi> Now I perſwade my ſelf, that neither the <hi>States,</hi> nor <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Company will ſtick upon theſe. For <hi>Polleron,</hi> if they have it, it can now neither be any great profit to them, nor prejudice us: For a juſt accompting with them, what juſt man can be againſt it? Or againſt a due and equal Regulation of Trade? that ſo all occaſions of conteſts between the two Nations may be cut off, and wholly prevented for the future. It is true, that reaches not the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal of our being under them, but only ſtanding upon equal terms
<pb facs="tcp:56430:36"/>with them for Trade: and therefore we will come cloſe up to the ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition in hand.</p>
                  <p>And herein we ſhall proceed with ſuch franckneſs, that we ſhall grant more than our adverſaries can reaſonably be jealous of; and that is, that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſhould have half of that Trade with us; and yet ſhew that it is better for us then to take in <hi>France.</hi> For, 1. The <hi>Engliſh</hi> have a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable part already, and <hi>France</hi> but an inconſiderable: ſo that we muſt, in all probability, part with much more to the latter, and need part with leſs to the former. Our firſt capital of the <hi>Eaſt-India Company,</hi> is 64 Tun of Gold, and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> 40. It is true we have Traded both longer and more, and ſo have a greater improvement: ſuppoſe 70 Tun of Gold there, which ordinarily is reckoned about three times in the value when returned hither; and ſuppoſe as much or more here in goods or money; which vaſtly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds the <hi>Engliſh:</hi> yet it muſt be conſidered that we are at greater expences there ſeveral ways than they; that we have money at intereſt, though in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable to what formerly, having pay'd off the laſt year above 50, ſome ſay 60 Tun of Gold. I muſt here ingenuouſly confeſs, that I have but the forementioned calculations from the cur<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>oſity of diſcourſe, and the credit of others; not upon the authentick authority of the books of both Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies; which I have not leiſure now, nor indeed pleaſure to enquire into; and yet I think I am near the truth, having had theſe things from very good hands. I will therefore proceed, and here we are certain, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides a great ſum of money, our Company hath lent the States to carry on this War, which I reckon as an honourable gift, we are like to part with a far greater to purchaſe our peace. And though our <hi>Actions</hi> be far more worth than theirs, for example, a capital <hi>Action</hi> that gives right to a ſuffrage, in the election of the Directors of that Trade being originally 100 <abbr>l</abbr> Vlamiſh, (or 1800 <abbr>g</abbr>) and in times of peace 400 <abbr>l</abbr> Vl. (or 2400 <abbr>g</abbr>) and ſometimes 500 <abbr>l</abbr> Vl. (or 3000 <abbr>g</abbr>) and with them not worth two, or twelve: yet this ariſes not ſo much from the great emolument, that the Participants here receive more than there, as from the plenty of money here, which ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral have and know not how otherwiſe to improve, the ſmall Intereſt (uſually under 4 per Cento to thoſe of good credit) and the dearneſs of Land; all which are contrary in <hi>England.</hi> So that I leave it to any compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent and impartial man to judge, (ſhould it be ſo, which yet, I think, none need to fear) whether it is better for us to ſupply the <hi>Engliſh</hi> with a leſs part, or the <hi>French</hi> with a greater of that our Trade. For I dare ſay, that if <hi>England</hi> hath a fourth of ours, <hi>France</hi> hath not an eighth part thereof.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. How eaſie is it for us and <hi>England</hi> to beat <hi>France</hi> out of the <hi>Eaſt-India Traſſek?</hi> if we have Wars, or if the <hi>French</hi> ſeek to incroach upon us.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Under <hi>England</hi> we keep our own <hi>Chambers of Trade;</hi> whereby thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of Families ſubſiſt in our <hi>Cities.</hi> All manner of Trades for Shipping
<pb facs="tcp:56430:37"/>and navigation, Carpenters, Smithes, Sail-makers, &amp;c. All manner of Tradeſmen for victuals, Bakers, Brewers, Butchers, &amp;c. by their labours at leaſt. All manner of Shopkeepers for ſelling them Proviſions that are ſent, and buy commodities that return. Beſides the poorer ſort, as Boats<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folk, Labourers, &amp;c. which are exceeding many that wholly depend on the Company for their livelihood. Whereas if we come under <hi>France,</hi> and the <hi>Spaniſh Provinces</hi> alſo, as we may reaſonably ſuppoſe; a great ſhare will be removed to <hi>Antwerp,</hi> there being ſo large and magnificent an <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> houſe, and that being nearer <hi>France</hi> by far. Whereby our Trade being taken from us, our Cities will be impoveriſhed beyond imagination.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The impoſitions of the Crown of <hi>England</hi> is with conſent of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in Parliament; the rates both inward and outward being ſet by law: and ſo would be here with conſent of the States. Thoſe of <hi>France</hi> arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, and inhanſible at pleaſure.

                  <p>Firſt, We cannot beat them out there, till we have conquered them here: for how ſhall we in Wars with them, ſpare Ships, Souldiers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to do that? Now what probability there is of conquering them, is formerly declared. The <hi>Engliſh</hi> are reaſonably fortified and provided, and will doubtleſs be better, if they ſee danger approaching. And not only ſo, but being in good amity (as I have heard) with thoſe Nations where they reſide, they would never ſuffer our enmity to prevail ſo far againſt them. Nor thoſe Nations with whom we both Trade: for knowing how low one chapman makes the market, they will aſſiſt the weaker, rather than loſe their advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage by them.</p>
                  <p>Nor if we ſhould conquer them there, will all the ſpoils fall to our ſelves; as ſome may poſſibly think, whoſe hopes are poſtilion to the Sun, and therefore fancy things beyond the Moon; and bring ſuch booties from Eaſt to Weſt upon the wings of their windy imaginations. For inſtead of hoping to have half, we have reaſon to fear, ſhould it be ſo, that <hi>France.</hi> will have all the parts of the <hi>Prey.</hi>

                  <p n="5">5. If we be under <hi>France,</hi> what ſhall become of our <hi>Fiſhery</hi> upon the Coaſt of <hi>England,</hi> and thoſe multitudes of Families that depend thereon? I might be large herein from my own Obſervations, having had the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour or curioſity (call it what you pleaſe) to view all the Rivers, Harbors, and almoſt Creeks on both the oppoſite Coaſts, from <hi>Thames</hi> to <hi>Tinmouth,</hi> and from the <hi>Elve</hi> to <hi>Ooſtend.</hi> And particularly <hi>Yarmouth</hi> and <hi>Flambrough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head,</hi> as the greateſt Promontories of <hi>England,</hi> and whereabouts there is the beſt fiſhing. But I will only ſpeak to thoſe things which concern
<pb facs="tcp:56430:37"/>the preſent Argument. A diligent perſon calculated in the Year 62 the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendants on the <hi>Fiſhing-trade</hi> (I mean not Fiſhers only, but alſo all employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed about their ſhipping, Nets, Cask, Salt, &amp;c. with their Attendants at Sea) and reckoned them above 400000. Yea ſome have made their number far greater, particularly that learned, wiſe, and valiant Knight Sir <hi>Walter Rawleigh</hi> (whom I parallel with Sir <hi>Philip Sidney</hi>) in his information of King <hi>James,</hi> reckons our Veſſels that fiſh on the Coaſts of Great <hi>Britain</hi> 3000 and every 20 Buſſes to maintain 8000, which will amount to 1200000. But this is incredible. He muſt either be miſtaken in the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Ships, or the proportion he alots them, or both. For upon diligent enquiry I cannot find half that number either of Ships or Men in ſome years laſt paſt. If he mean of the three ſeveral ſeaſons of fiſhing; in Autumn for Herrings, Spring for Cod-fiſh, and Summer for Salmons; we ſhall not conteſt with him; nor concerning the number he ſays attends them, viz. 9000 other Veſſels, and 150000 Men. It is ſufficient for my preſent pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, that I ſhew, that our Fiſhery is very conſiderable, and the friendſhip of <hi>England</hi> for the ſame, of far more conſequence to us than that of <hi>France.</hi>

Yea I rather think, that ſince our Merchandiſe hath ſo much increaſed, our Fiſhery hath decreaſed.</p>
                  <p>And what conſiderable profit redounds to us thereby, appears by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation which <hi>Guieciardine</hi> makes very particularly, that thoſe 700 Buſſes take annually 49000 Laſt of Herring, which he reckons at 10 l. Vl. or 60. Guldens the Laſt; which amounts yearly together with the other Fiſheries to the following ſums.</p>

                  <pb facs="tcp:56430:38"/>

                  <p>Other Arguments which might here be added I ſhall not now bring into open view, but keep them as a Reſerve, in caſe our Adverſaries ſhould ral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and make head againſt us, having ſufficiently rooted them (we think) by theſe five, wherewith we have already fought them.</p>
                  <p>But yet there remain ſome advantages under <hi>England,</hi> which we cannot expect under <hi>France,</hi> ſome of them more general for the Republick, and otherſome more particular for Provinces and Perſons. In the handling whereof, we ſhall deſire to uſe, now that we are got within our enemy, the ſhort and pungent dagger of <hi>Demoſthenes,</hi> rather than <hi>Cicero</hi>'s long ſword<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed eloquence.</p>

               <div type="subsection">
                  <head>Advantages under England, not to be expected under France.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. By being under <hi>England,</hi> we retain and encreaſe our friendſhip with the <hi>Empire, German Princes,</hi> and <hi>free Cities:</hi> which are not jealous of
<hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands</hi> affecting the <hi>Imperial Crown,</hi> as they are of <hi>France:</hi> and therefore will not prejudice us under the former, as they will certainly in a little time under the latter. Nay I doubt not, but were we under <hi>England,</hi> they would take courage, and generally appear againſt <hi>France.</hi> So that we ſhould here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by greatly promote the common Intereſt of <hi>Europe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Under <hi>England</hi> we might have the freedom of the <hi>Weſt-Indie</hi> Trade, which would be of great profit to us, many ways. Now how great a ſhare <hi>England</hi> hath in the <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> and how ſmall and inconſiderable <hi>France,</hi> is well known. Theſe having only the Iſland <hi>Terre Neuf,</hi> for fiſhing, and ſome of the moſt Northerly Continent, unpeopled, not cultivated, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable, as may be ſeen in <hi>de Laet,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Deſcript. Ind. occid. L. <hi>2.</hi>
                     </note> by thoſe that know it not: part of St. <hi>Chriſtophors,</hi> and ſome other places of ſmall concernment, in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to what the <hi>Engliſh</hi> profitably poſſeſs.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. By being under <hi>England,</hi> we might ſhare at leaſt with the <hi>Engliſh</hi> thoſe Plantations we have in the <hi>W. Indies; Holland</hi> in their <hi>New Netherland,</hi> and <hi>Zeeland</hi> in <hi>Surinam,</hi> &amp;c. Which would be of eminent advantage for Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, either there or to be ſent thither; beſides the profit we might have from thoſe Plantations; as <hi>Zeeland</hi> (or ſome at leaſt therein) even in theſe firſt years and beginning thereof, have pretty well experienced, and know how greatly it is further improvable. Now what a ſingular benefit it is for a full and populous Common-wealth, now and then like the ſedulous Bees,
<pb facs="tcp:56430:38"/>to caſt a ſwarm of their pooreſt and moſt laborious people, is apparent from the Hiſtories of all Ages. And though I confeſs the <hi>Dutch</hi> are not ſo good Planters, as the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> being more uſed to the Water, and the other to Land: yet in regard all thoſe <hi>Plantations</hi> are upon the Sea Coaſts and Rivers, the <hi>Dutch</hi> might be uſed for building of Ships or Boats, Houſes &amp;c. and eſpecially for fiſhing, carrying and recarrying goods by Water on the Rivers, and to and from the Ships, and in navigation; and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> for planting and working in the ground; and ſo, in mine opinion, would make an excellent temperament, and very profitable for both Nations.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Expences might be ſaved in ſeveral Conveys, and particularly of the <hi>Eaſt India</hi> Companies. I know very well they will have them return round about, on the back of <hi>Ireland,</hi> leſt they ſhould touch at any of theſe Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern places, eſpecially in the Chanel, and ſo Trade; and will ſend out Ships with freſh men, and take out the Mariners that return, to prevent their trading for themſelves: but yet the extraordinary Charges of our men of War might be ſpared. Nay the <hi>States General</hi> bring in theſe, to be didu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted in the Accompt with <hi>England,</hi> as the occaſion thereof, in their <hi>Liſt of damages Article the 5. before the laſt War,</hi> A. D. 1664.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Such as are Rich, and weary of Trade, or love their eaſe, honour, or pleaſure; may if we were under <hi>England,</hi> more eaſily remove thither, and be made <hi>liege</hi> ſubjects, and free <hi>Denizens</hi> of <hi>England</hi> by the <hi>Crown;</hi> or be <hi>naturalized</hi> by the <hi>Parliament;</hi> and ſo buy poſſeſs, and inherit Lands and revenues at half the price here; and live upon their Rents as Country Gentlemen, in a cheap and pleaſant Land, enjoying as great civil Liberty as any where in Chriſtendom, and alſo the freedom of their Religion. Or let out their money not only at far greater intereſt, but alſo upon <hi>bypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thece</hi> or real ſecurity. I have often thought this 20 years, whether it might not be better for <hi>England,</hi> to give this Liberty by Law to ſtrangers, eſpecially thoſe of the Reformed Religion, and of theſe Countries; and of which ſide the intereſt lay betwixt us for this: Now that <hi>England</hi> hath ſo many and great Plantations in the <hi>Weſt Indies</hi> for their poorer people, now that money is ſo plentiful, now that this Common-wealth was ſo increaſed upon them, now that the Number of Merchants is every where ſo multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, and now that Trade is beaten ſo low, almoſt in all the known parts of the World. But this would be both a large, and unneceſſary digreſſion, and I am very ſenſible that I have been already too long in this Argument. Yet induſtriouſly I confeſs, becauſe I foreſee, that many will diligently peruſe this, who perhaps will negligently paſs by the reſt: and mine Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſites ſo much glorying herein, I thought beſt to give them full meaſure, and rather abound to curioſitie, than be deficient in ſatisfying the leaſt nicity; <hi>Trade being the Crown of that Kingdom and this Common wealth.</hi>

               <p n="1">1. The different humor and genious of the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Dutch:</hi> which is well known to thoſe that know them both, to be far greater than between us and the <hi>Engliſh.</hi> Which makes not only a ſt<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>neſs, but alienation of affection; begets a diſguſt and nauſeating of each other; brings forth many conteſts and quarrels; and nouriſhes a continual diſcontent, uneaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and unquietneſs of life.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The affection which the generallity of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> Nation have for each other. So that if the Controverſies of late years, and at this preſent between us, had been or were refered to the body of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in both Nations (although I well know what both their <hi>Repreſentatives</hi> have done) I dare ſay, upon reaſonable ſatisfaction for the mutual miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages, which cannot but ſome times happen towards each other; there never had been, nor would be War betwixt us more. And that his <hi>Majeſty,</hi> and the <hi>Prince of Orange</hi> would have more Voluntiers in one day to fight the <hi>French,</hi> than they have in twenty to fight each other.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The way of <hi>France</hi> is only <hi>Gentry</hi> and <hi>Paiſantry,</hi> the former lording it over the latter, which have allways lived more miſerably, than any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon people in <hi>Europe.</hi> In <hi>Caeſars</hi> time there was <hi>nibil plebe contemptius,</hi> as he tells us, and hath continued ſo as <hi>Bodin</hi> acknowledges, and is ſo at this day we all know.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>C.</hi> 1. <hi>C.</hi> 10.</note> Whereas in <hi>England</hi> and theſe <hi>Countries,</hi> there is a middle ſort of people, that live freely and independently, on their own Lands and Farmes, that will never endure the inſolency of ſuch Lords much leſs to be their ſlaves, and leaſt of all to be ruined by them.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Now that the <hi>Prince of Orange</hi> is advanced, and his party upmoſt, ſo that the Crown of <hi>England</hi> may confide more in our friendſhip; it is not to be doubted but through his <hi>Highneſs</hi> intereſt in his Uncles, we ſhall better accord hereafter, when theſe unhappy differences are once ended.</p>
               <p>And thus I have done with this great <hi>Queſtion</hi> of the times. Sufficiently, I thinke, to ſatisfie any rational man; though nothing is ſufficient, nor will ſatisfie I know, ſuch as are either ſo reſolvedly prejudiced againſt the <hi>Engliſh</hi> or Princes intereſt that if they can but ruin them, they matter not though they ruin both themſelves and the Nation; or ſo partially paſſionate for the <hi>French,</hi> that they deſire them, though it be to their own deſtruction. For all the Arguments in the World, will never prevail againſt paſſion and prejudice: It is only experience that can convince ſuch of their error, and make them with <hi>Damocles,</hi> when the drawn Sword is over them, deſire
<pb facs="tcp:56430:39"/>to depart, finding they were deceived in their opinion of Happineſs.</p>
               <p>I ſhall therefore conclude, with a brief reflection upon ſome of theſe Arguments, and the Corollary which naturally flows from them.</p>
               <p>That ſeeing <hi>England</hi> and We are of the ſame Religion; Both free people and affectionated to each other; Both imbarqued in the ſame Intereſt of Trade, though in different bottoms; It not only becomes us, but is our mutual concernment, that we take heed, we daſh not one another to pieces, but fairly and Chriſtianly comply with each other, for the ſafeguard of our Religion, preſervation of the Proteſtant Intereſt, our own and others alſo Liberties, and the juſt and equitable courſe of Commerce; that ſo each Nation may happily enjoy their <hi>Religion, Liberty, Eſtates,</hi> and <hi>Trade,</hi> with Gods bleſſing on them all.</p>

               <p n="1">1. The great ſtrength of a people conſiſts in the <hi>ſituation of their Country.</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:56430:40"/>Now concerning this both in the general,<note place="margin">Sect. 7.</note> and this Land in particular, I have already ſpoken ſufficiently for my purpoſe; and ſhewn that all theſe Maritime Provinces, are either Iſlands or Peninſular, and very defenſible thereby; and alſo upon extremity liable to inundation, either from the Sea, or Rivers that ſurround them, or both.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In the Artificial Fortification of particular places; <hi>Cities, Caſtles, Forts, Paſſes,</hi> &amp;c. And herein theſe Countries may contend with any Nation whatſoever, Kingdom, or Common-wealth that is of no greater circumference. For the Number of their Cities, and their regular Forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, Art herein vying with Nature, is not to be parallel'd in the world. I need not deſcend to particulars, Thoſe that deſire ſatisfaction herein, may conſult <hi>Guicciardine</hi>'s deſcription of theſe Netherlands.</p>
               <p n="3">3. In means of defence. As ſhipping for thoſe Nations or Cities that lie upon the Sea, or great navigable Rivers, and Lakes, as theſe Provinces do, to defend their Coaſts from invaſion. And herein we are rather re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dundant than defective; the Number of ſhipping in <hi>Holland</hi> alone, being uſually accounted 20000. And warlike proviſion of Arms and Ammuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Wherein alſo we abound: theſe Countries ever ſince they were a Common-wealth, having been the greateſt Magazine of warlike proviſions, as is well known, of any in the World.</p>
               <p n="4">4. In men; in regard of their Number, Courage, Skill, and Una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimity.</p>
               <p>As to our Numbers, they are abundantly ſufficient for our defence. The <hi>Intereſt</hi> of <hi>Holland</hi> c. 8. from particulars, reckons the ſum of that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince alone 2400000. But if there be ſo many in them all, it is enow. Juſt how many is impoſſible to ſay, or near how many in ſuch a multitude is very difficult to gueſs, and harder with us than any other people, I think, in the World; in regard of the uncertainty of Seamen, the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Strangers and Travellers in peaceable times, and the diverſity of Religions, Jews, Papiſts, Anabaptiſts, &amp;c. which baptiſe not their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren with us. But I know the Number of our men muſt needs be great; by the great Number of our Cities, theſe ſeveral Provinces being as it were nothing but Neſts of Cities, ſo many being no where to be found in ſo ſmall a circumference in any parts of the habitable World; by their largeneſs and multitude of houſes, which imply the Inhabitants to be many; by the greatneſs of their Trade, which is the lure that draws mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes to them; and by the known Chriſtnings and burials of thoſe only of the Reformed Religion.</p>
               <p>As to our courage, which at preſent ſuffers an eclipſe, there is more to be ſaid then the World is aware of. And indeed I wonder none of our Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory Profeſſors, have given other Nations ſome ſatisfaction herein. I have not been without ſome thoughts of doing it my ſelf, having been a diligent obſerver how things have gone, but I want Authentick materials for ſuch a work. I could produce very many and very honourable teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies,
<pb facs="tcp:56430:40"/>both ancient and modern of their valour, our of ſuch Writers as give the Characters of Nations, Republicks, Geographers, and eſpecially Hiſtorians <hi>Dion, Caeſar, Tacitus, Suetonius, Florus, Oroſius,</hi> &amp;c. of old, the famous <hi>Italians, Guicciardine, Bentivoglio</hi> and <hi>Strada,</hi> with <hi>Spaniſh, French, Engliſh</hi> and the neighbouring Nations, even ſo many and ſuch as are ſufficient either to ſhame, or to inflame the verieſt cowards, one ſhould think, of the world into courage. But this would be too large to inſert here, and may poſſibly de done in another dreſs hereafter. Nor is the ſucceſs of <hi>France</hi> againſt us ſuch a wonder, as many make it, as I have formerly ſhewn.<note place="margin">Sect. 7.</note> I will at preſent only add, that which is proper for this place, and that is that the <hi>French</hi> Armies were not only ſo numerous, but alſo trained up in the School of <hi>Mars,</hi> and ours for the moſt part raw and unexperienced in War. As the Fox in the Fable, the firſt time he ſaw the Lion and heard him roar, trembled; the ſecond time, was leſs affraid, and the third grown wholly fearleſs of him: So it is with men, by being accuſtomed to dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers either at Sea or Land, they converſe with them familiary, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count them nothing at laſt. And therefore wiſe Commanders have always endeavoured to unlearn their Souldiers fear, by ſhewing them their enemies at Walls, Trenches, Paſſes, Rivers or other places, where they could not be come upon by them, and ſo harden and fleſh them by degrees, before they have adventured to fight them againſt old and experienced ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. And I doubt not, but through Gods bleſſing, in a little time if the Wars continue, our Belgick Lion, will not be found ſuch a tame Lamb, and ſo eaſily torn in pieces, as our enemies may hope, and others poſſibly may imagin.</p>
               <p>As for our skill ſuperadded to courage, there is no want, for the manner of defence we are to make. For beſides our able Commanders and Souldiers to defend the Poſts, and Paſſes abroad, all our Cities abound with Seamen, and ſuch as are skil'd to traverſe their Ordnance, and deſperate for ſallies, if need ſhould require.</p>
               <p>Our unanimity, I confeſs, is that I moſt fear: and that when our Cities are threatned with danger, the Citizens ſhould grow mutinous, and fall together by the ears, and ſo let in their enemies to part the fray. And yet I have reaſon to think they will grow wiſer, by their hearing and knowing how their freinds are uſed by their enemies.</p>
               <p n="5">5. In money and food to maintain their men. And in neither of theſe, through Gods mercy, is there any want amongſt us: If we will lay out our ſelves, as we ought, for the publick. <hi>Aitſma's Liewe</hi> reckons the publick incoms of <hi>Holland</hi> alone A. 1643. at eleven Millions of our money, which is eleven hundred thouſand pounds Sterling: we calling every ten thouſand pound Sterling a tun of gold, and ever hundred thouſand a million <hi>i. e.</hi> of gilders. And beſides the publick incoms of every Province, every City hath their peculiar, which in ſome is very conſiderble. But if our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Treaſuries are exhauſted in ſeveral places, it is no wonder: Yet if we
<pb facs="tcp:56430:41"/>conſider the Riches of particular perſons, we have enough to hold out the War, to weary our enemies out at the laſt, as muſt as they do us at the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent. I will not now ſtand to ſhew the calculation of this, though if neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, I think I can do it ſatisfactorily, comprehending the diſadvantages our enemies are under. But the late Project printed ſo often, of the <hi>Capitals</hi> of this Country, for raiſing and maintaining ſo numerous an Army, though the manner preſcribed prove not practicable, hath in part ſpared my pains herein.</p>
               <p>And for food, our Cities are generally ſo well furniſhed, that if our enemies ſteal not ſupplies from us, it is well; we need neither ſeek to them, nor fight with them for ſupplying our ſelves. We have Bread Corn Fiſh and Oyl, Butter and Cheeſe in abundance. And if our liquoriſh Dames, want their delicacies a while, no great matter: they will value peace, and pay their Souldiers the better.</p>
               <p>Now what can be added for the ſufficient defence of any Nation, to the particulars mentioned, I cannot imagin; and if my enumeration be inſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient, I wiſh any wiſe man would ſhew wherein, and then I ſhall thank them. And therefore let us take courage to our ſelves, and not be frighted with vain fears; or ſcared with any vanting bravadoes; like that great <hi>Rhodomontadoe</hi> of the grand <hi>Turk,</hi> who when he heard of the long War ſuch a great Prince as <hi>Spain,</hi> made about this ſmall Country; ſaid, <hi>that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he would have kept ſuch a pottering, about a few petty Provinces, he would have taken them, and hurled them into the Sea at once:</hi> though his ſucceſſor kept no ſmall pottering about the ſingle City of <hi>Candia</hi> many years to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; to which ſome of our Cities, all things conſidered, ſeem not much inferior for ſtrength: although I well know what a difference there is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the defence of one City alone without a Country, and many at once contained therein.</p>
               <p>But though this <hi>internal ſtrength</hi> be ſo conſiderable, and with us of great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt conſequence; yet this is not all; we have alſo an <hi>external and accidental ſtrength,</hi> by the Intereſt of our Neighbours. For this end it muſt be well conſidered, that ſome Countries and Cities, of ſmall ſtrength compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively in themſelves, are yet very ſtrong by their ſituation among, and well ſecured by the Intereſt of other circumjacent Princes and States: who will not ſuffer, if they can poſſibly prevent it, acceſſion of ſtrength to one another, leſt their own ſcale in the ballance of powers ſhould become light and ſoon born down. What is it but this under the ſhadow of the Almighties Protection, that ſecures the ſmaller Republicks in <hi>Italy</hi> and the <hi>Empire?</hi> What <hi>Geneva, Stratsburg, Colen, Hamburg</hi> and the reſt of the free Cities, and <hi>Hans Towns,</hi> but this? God governing the World uſually, as both <hi>Comines</hi> and <hi>Cardan</hi> well obſerve, by the paſſions of men, in the ballancing of Powers; that when any one will break out into rage and Wars, others will oppoſe them with the like fury, and ſo keep the World a little quiet, otherwiſe the great <hi>Nimrods,</hi> and hunters after Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
<pb facs="tcp:56430:41"/>would ſoon, if let alone, deſtroy and devour all before them.</p>
               <p>Now if we look about us, and ſee amongſt whom our Land lies, and well conſider their intereſt; this will be very apparent in our ſelves, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding this War that is made againſt us, that we are not devoted by any to deſtruction, but only the <hi>French,</hi> as I ſhall ſhew hereafter.</p>
               <p>For <hi>Spain</hi> our next Neighbours on one hand, in the reſt of the Provinces, they know this ſo well, and are ſo ſenſible of their intereſt herein; that they not only aſſiſt us what they can; but I dare ſay were it not for <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> would rather break with <hi>France</hi> than ſee us endangered. But thoſe two Crowns as I have already hinted, and ſhall more fully ſhew heareafter, muſt not, and therefore will not break.</p>
               <p>For the Empire above us, they alſo are frighted with our fears; and if the Princes thereof had money to their might, would willingly, I doubt not, aſſiſt the <hi>Emperor:</hi> leſt the <hi>Lillies</hi> of <hi>France</hi> ſhould mount above the <hi>Roman Eagle.</hi> In the year 15<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>4. when the States upon the death of Prince <hi>William,</hi> were a looking towards <hi>France</hi> for Protection, the Princes of the Empire ſent <hi>Malroy</hi> to admoniſh them, <hi>ut à conſilio Gallici patrocinii implo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>randi deſiſterent, alioqui fore, ut Germani Principes tantam domui Auſtriacae &amp; origine &amp; foedere arctis adeo cum Imperio vinculis conjunctae factam injuriam non negligant,</hi> as <hi>Thuanus</hi> tells us, <hi>l.</hi> 80. And if they were then jealous of <hi>France,</hi> what ſhall we think they are now? And if then zealous for the concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of <hi>Spain,</hi> ſhall we think they will now be wholly negligent both of theirs and their own?</p>
               <p>And <hi>France</hi> to be ſure will never ſee us entirely <hi>Engliſh:</hi> for ſo he knows, he ſhould never be able, to ballance <hi>Englands</hi> power at Sea; which he doubtleſs both hopes and aims at, by the acceſſion of ſtrength from theſe <hi>Netherlands.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nor <hi>England</hi> ſuffer us, if they can hinder it, to be wholly <hi>French;</hi> for this they know would clearly tend, in a little time to their deſtruction. This ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Reaſon of State moved <hi>Q. Elizabeth</hi> at firſt to ſupport us againſt <hi>Spain,</hi> rather than to have us fall into the Arms of <hi>France,</hi> by their becoming our Protectors. Which that wiſe Hiſtorian <hi>Thuanus</hi> faithfully relates in ſeveral places. A. 1575. ſhe told <hi>Campaniach,—ne moleſtè ferat Philippus, ſi ipſa ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritatis ſuae cauſa Hollandiae &amp; Zelandiae patrocinium ſuſcipiat, antequam Galli perpetui Anglorum hoſtes cis potiantur.</hi> L. 60. A. 1576. <hi>Eliſabeth a verita ne ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orum ope deſtituti Belgae, ex deſperatione foedus nobiſcum jecerent, ſique &amp; res ſuas Francis committerent, eos pecunia adjuvit, &amp;c.</hi> L. 26. A. 1577. ſhe excuſes her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of us to <hi>Philip</hi> the 2. with this very Reaſon, <hi>ne Belgae ex deſperatione per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicio ſum non ſolum ſibi, ſid vicinis, conſilium caperent, externi Principis patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinio ſalute commiſſa.</hi> Meaning the <hi>French</hi> L. 64. And A. 1584. ſhews the emulation between the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Engliſh</hi> herein. <hi>Ipſi ſibi invicem ſuſpecti e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant. Nam Rex veterem hoſtem Belgii acceſſione Galliae imminentem reformida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat, &amp; Angli noſtros Belgi-potentes minus aequos foederi, quod Angliae cum Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gundica domo intercedit, atque adeo commercio futuros verebantur.</hi> L. 80. And
<pb facs="tcp:56430:42"/>is angry with the Miniſters of State in <hi>France,</hi> for neglecting this ſingular occaſion, of enlarging their Empire by taking theſe Provinces into the <hi>French</hi> protection. And to ſay the truth, this was the greateſt error in Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy by way of omiſſion, and that of <hi>Charles</hi> the 8. concerning the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Naples</hi> of commiſſion, that I think the Crown of <hi>France</hi> was ever guilty of. And indeed there were many of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation, that judged it one of the greateſt overſights that that wiſe Princeſs ever made, not to take into her hands, as ſhe was offered, the abſolut protection of theſe Provinces. But that is not ſo clear to me, nor will be ſo I think to others, who rightly conſider the circumſtances of thoſe times; for we muſt not judge by the following, wherein this Common-wealth grew up beyond all expectation, under ſuch Wars, as many feared would have been our deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. But yet though ſhe refuſed for ſeveral reaſons both of Conſcience and State (mentioned by <hi>Cambden</hi> in her <hi>Annals,</hi> A.D. 1575.) yet it plainly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by the forementioned places in <hi>Thuanus,</hi> that rather than the <hi>French</hi> ſhould, ſhe would have done it. And could ſhe have foreſeen, what we have known, I am apt to think ſhe would have adventured it; although I muſt tell you it would have been a great venture: <hi>Spain</hi> being both ſo potent at that time, and ſpightful againſt her, as was quickly after perceived, by the <hi>Spaniſh Armado</hi> in 88. and beſides the enmity of <hi>Spain,</hi> ſhe had thereby in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur'd the envy of <hi>France</hi> infallibly, and was uncertain not only of ſucceſs in the War, but of what ſupport of men, and money eſpecially the <hi>Dutch</hi> ſhould be able to contribute, for the carrying on the War, which was eaſily foreſeen would be long and bloody.</p>
               <p>Nor can any one think, that <hi>England</hi> is not ſenſible, of the danger they are in, if we be under <hi>France,</hi> that either conſiders the Reaſons of State, or obeſerved that which was obvious to every eye: and that is how the <hi>Engliſh</hi> was ſtartled at the progreſs of <hi>France.</hi> What poſting was made too and again? Was not the <hi>Lord Vicount of Hallifax</hi> haſted over, when they feared their approach to <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>trecht?</hi> And hearing it was over, was not his <hi>Grace the Duke of Buckingham,</hi> the <hi>Lord Arlington,</hi> with ſeveral other Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners, poſted after? At which time having the honour to wait on my <hi>Lord of Hallifax,</hi> and telling him the Town talk of the D. of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> &amp;c. coming through the Fleet, and being gone to the <hi>Hague;</hi> he could ſcarce credit it, having not had the leaſt notice thereof, they coming away in ſuch haſte, for fear the <hi>French</hi> ſhould overrun all.</p>
               <p>And no wonder, if we conſider the Conſequences thereof for <hi>England,</hi> which are ſo great that they had better loſe either <hi>Scotland,</hi> or <hi>Ireland.</hi> And if any <hi>Engliſh</hi> think I overlaſh, I ſhall deſire them firſt carefully to compute theſe ſeveral particulars, and then cenſure.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. The loſs that the King will have in his Cuſtoms, and the Kingdom in their Trade; which neither of thoſe Nations can compenſate.</item>
                  <item>2. The conſtant charges of maintaining a Navy, which that Kingdom muſt be at to maintain their traffick, far greater than will ſecure them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt either of thoſe Kingdoms.</item>
                  <pb facs="tcp:56430:42"/>
                  <item>3. The great injuries they are always liable unto, from ſuch potent ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies by Sea as the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> conjoined: more than from the other by Sea and Land.</item>
                  <item>4. The Wars that are likely to fall upon them in a few years both by Sea and perhaps Land alſo; which would prove far heavier, than either of thoſe Kingdoms can make with them.</item>
                  <item>5. The hazard they run of being baffled and beat out of their Trade by ſuch a War. It is true, this is not ſo eaſie as many of the <hi>Dutch</hi> imagine, as I have already proved; nor yet ſo difficult, much leſs impoſſible, as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps ſome of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> may fancy.</item>
               </list>
               <p>I ſhall not now ſtand to draw theſe out of their cloſe order into an open, yet if any of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> think me weak in this, I have a Reſerve, which, I think, will ſufficiently ſecure me from being routed.</p>
               <p>It will be ſaid to me why then ſhould <hi>England</hi> commence this War.</p>
               <p>Truly let me ſay it freely, for I know it, that the ſcale of War very hardly caſt that of peace, and the difference was ſo ſmall, that it came upon two or three grains only. I have weighed this as exactly as I poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly could: firſt diſtinguiſhing pretexts from real cauſes, and then diſtinctly conſidering theſe one by one. There were theſe 5 variouſly diſcourſed of. His Majeſties deſigning to introduce the Popiſh Religion; to alter the government of thoſe Kingdoms; to revenge himſelf upon us, to advance the <hi>Prince of Orange;</hi> and the Intereſt of the Kingdom of <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the two firſt which made the loudeſt noiſe in ſome mens mouths, I ſoon found them frivolous; and only calumnies caſt out by his enemies at home and abroad, to make the King odious, and his People jealous. As to that of changing Religion I have formerly ſhewn, and I think ſufficiently, that he neither will, nor can if he would effect it.</p>
               <p>As for the 2d. I conſidered the Kings years, as being paſt any ſuch youth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and vain ambition; his being deſtitute of a Child that can challenge the Crown; his former miſeries and ſufferings by War; and his wiſdom too great, to ſet upon a deſign, ſo wholly impracticable, eſpecially in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland.</hi> For by the conſtitution of his Kingdoms, though he have the <hi>Militis</hi> for the execution of the Laws; authority without power, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a vain ſcare crow, and inſufficient to ſuppreſs the audacious exorbitances of the multitude: yet the people have the purſe to ballance that power, and whence then would he pay his Armies? Nor let any one ſtop me with ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the Long Parliament conteſted with his Father for the <hi>Militia;</hi> for that was only temporary, they challenging it only for that time of the danger they apprehended in the Kingdom, and not as their conſtant right, and not belonging to the Crown; as may be ſeen by thoſe, who will rightly read their Declarations, which they publiſhed to the world concerning that War, collected and printed together by <hi>Husbands</hi> at <hi>London,</hi> 1642. And beſides this, a Parliament in being though not ſitting, which hath
<pb facs="tcp:56430:43"/>ſome kind of radical power; though not to be exerted, but when legally congregated. But ſuppoſe them diſſolved, it being in the Kings power, to do it at his pleaſure; yet hath he not the City of <hi>London</hi> on his back, and both Kingdoms about him to oppoſe him? eſpecially conſidering that the jealouſie of Popery would be taken into the quarrel. And what Miniſters of State durſt ſuggeſt ſuch deſigns? they know well the maxim of the <hi>Commons</hi> and their practice (as the great means of preſerving their freedom) is <hi>to ruine ſuch as would infringe their Liberty.</hi> And that they are ſo jealous of, and zealous for their rights herein, that ſome of them ſtill have the courage, and reſolution to venture their own heads, to break the necks of ſuch men and ſuch defigns, as would prejudice their Priviledges. I have obſerved in the Hiſtories of former times, and in my own time alſo, that there were ſeldom any of the nobleſt Stags of State, how much ſoever imparked in the Kings favour, and how ſtrongly ſoever impaled with power; but if the <hi>Commons</hi> of <hi>England</hi> ſingled him out and ſet upon him, though he might hold them at an abay for ſome time, yet they ſtill hunted him down at laſt. And for the King to think of making himſelf abſolute, and govern only by an Army (like the <hi>French</hi> Kings) by an Army of <hi>French</hi> men; is ſo ridiculous, that I thought it not worthy of conſideration. Can any man in his wits, imagine his Majeſty of <hi>England</hi> ſo ſenſeleſs, as to give his Crown and Kingdoms to the <hi>French</hi> King? For that is all one with this in effect.</p>
               <p>As for that of <hi>Revenge,</hi> either for <hi>Chattam,</hi> or the affronts mentioned in his Declaration of this War, or both: I conſidered his <hi>Temper,</hi> which hath ſo much <hi>Clemency,</hi> that it rather inclines him to <hi>lenity</hi> than <hi>cruelty</hi> and <hi>revenge.</hi> As is abundantly apparent, not only by paſſing, but even forcing (as I know he did, againſt ſome adicted to the latter extreme) the <hi>Act of Indemnity</hi> or <hi>Oblivion,</hi> for thoſe many and great injuries, he had ſuffered from his Subjects. And his government ſince, in conniving at the viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſuch Laws, as are thought ſevere in matters of Religion, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulging liberty therein: which hath made ſome, that have ſufficiently heretofore cried up Parliaments, now run into the other extreme and cry them down as faſt; and inſtead of the Parliaments formerly, now magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the Kings favour and Clemency. And yet Kings and Princes are men, and men ſubject to like paſſions with others, liable to ſuggeſtions from thoſe about them, and tender of their honour as the apple of their eye. And therefore I will grant this might come in conſideration, but not ſo much, I dare ſay, as alone to make a War.</p>
               <p>For the <hi>Prince of Orange,</hi> there was not only near Relation and Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, but Intereſt alſo to be conſidered. For the <hi>Loveſteyns</hi> party having been ſo croſs to <hi>England</hi> upon his account, and the correſpondent friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip between us ſo uncertain, without his Headſhip; I verily believe, that if what is now done therein, had been done timouſly, it had wholly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented this unhappy War. Yea beſides the extraordinary affection which
<pb facs="tcp:56430:43"/>the people have for the Prince, our very Bores had this Policy, and were more than ordinary zealous for his promotion, as the beſt means to procure their peace.</p>
               <p>As to the further intereſt of the Kingdom of <hi>England,</hi> in regard of their Trade, and Naval expences, I have expreſſed my thoughts before in the <hi>Preface.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is true, this War was always intricate, and hath proved a Game at Hazard for <hi>England,</hi> beyond not only theirs, I believe, but all the worlds expectation. But yet if it be ſtill notwithſtanding cautiouſly played, as they may, and ſo far as I can poſſibly diſcern, mean to play it; they can many ways come to ſave their ſtakes, at the leaſt, if not to win more than we imagine by the War: and was far fairer at firſt than <hi>France</hi> for win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning by the game in all humane appearance, as I could manifeſt by many Arguments. But becauſe that concerns them two only, and us not at all further than our ſufferings, I ſhall wave them (at leaſt for the preſent) and proceed. For I will not hearken to the curious enquiries of thoſe who would here be asking, how I think <hi>England</hi> will play their game? for that let them look to it whom it concerns on all ſides, as doubtleſs they will; for me to expreſs my private thoughts, might do more hurt than good, which is the only thing I aim at: and what I think the iſſue will be, I ſhall declare hereafter in my <hi>Conjectures.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But here it will be asked, ſeeing it is <hi>Englands</hi> intereſt that we fall not into the hands of <hi>France,</hi> and that the Prince is now promoted, will they not make peace with us this Winter?</p>
               <p>I muſt needs ſay, I fear they will not, except we ſhould give them ſuch terms, as I ſee we ſhall not; we thinking our condition far better, and they thinking it far worſe, than really it is. For the cauſe of this, as of moſt Wars, is complex, as I have ſhewn; ſo that though two of thoſe I aſſigned may be paſt, yet the 3<hi rend="sup">d</hi> of the Kingdoms intereſt, not. They are already too far ingaged in the War, and with <hi>France.</hi> The Kings Honour is at the ſtake, and the Kingdoms expectation of another iſſae than the laſt War. And beſides all theſe, how can any wiſe man imagine, now that they are engaged with <hi>France,</hi> and have an advantage againſt us, as well as a Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard from <hi>France;</hi> that if they know how to ſecure themſelves againſt the latter (as I ſuppoſe they do) they will let go the former? For we muſt needs think they will be at a certainty on one ſide or the other; and not part with <hi>France's</hi> friendſhip, till they be ſure of our ſatisfaction. What it is they demand, or how rightly, is not now our deſign to diſcourſe, but only matter of Intereſt all along. And yet I can eaſily foreſee that the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of our becoming <hi>French,</hi> will be a ſingular advantage to us, as an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducement to them, for a more eaſie compliance with us. But at preſent I ſee no probability of Peace, but that they will go through with the War: or continue it ſo long, till they have tryed their utmoſt to obtain their ends.</p>
               <p>I know there are many wiſe men amongſt us, that think the King can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb facs="tcp:56430:44"/>carry on this War: as there was that thought he could not begin it. The former they find themſelves deceived in, and will be ſo in the latter alſo. I have diſcourſed this with ſeveral in Government, who argue that the King hath not money of himſelf to go through with the War, and that he will not convene the Parliament, or if he do they will not ſupply him. I grant the firſt, but deny the others. For if we rightly conſider their defign, the Parliament muſt meet, and the repreſentation that will be made thereof, and the conſtitution of the Parliament, they will grant him ſupplies; though perhaps not with that facility, that they did it with in the former War. And therefore let us neither flatter nor deceive our ſelves with vain hopes herein; but rather ſeek timely to accommodate differences, before their preparations in the Spring; for I fear the longer we delay, and the worſe it will be with us.</p>

               <p>HAving thus declared the condition that we are in, and that there is no probability of peace; we come now to ſhew the conſequences thereof; and what is to be done by us, to preſerve our ſelves from ruine and deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. And here to my underſtanding one of theſe three things muſt neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily follow: That we muſt either continue the War againſt them both; or comply with them both; or with one of them alone if poſſibly we can. We ſhall firſt declare our thoughts concerning theſe briefly, and then ſhew with which we both may and muſt comply.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Then whether we ſhould continue the War againſt them both. And herein would we do, as we might and ſhould; it may be this were better, than to comply with either of them, eſpecially if they will impoſe upon us unreaſonable conditions, and much better than to comply with them both. We have ſtrength enough, through Gods bleſſing, to withſtand them (as I have already manifeſted) if we have but courage, and unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity; and the former of theſe will be got by degrees, as I have ſaid, and our own intereſt, and preſervation ſhould perſwade us into the latter. But truly let me ſay it freely, I ſee ſuch a wearineſs in many of the War; ſuch an unwillingneſs to lay out our ſelves, as our Anceſtors did formerly, for the good of the publick; ſuch a ſelfiſh temper, every one ſeeking to preſerve his particular intereſt, and neglecting the good of the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; and ſuch a lothneſs to adventure our lives and eſtates in a War; that I ſee little probability of preſerving our ſelves, and much leſs of prevalency againſt our Enemies. So that if this War continue I fear theſe Provinces will become a prey to them both. For though neither <hi>France</hi> will ſuffer <hi>England,</hi> nor <hi>England France</hi> to have them all, as I have ſhewn; yet they will part and ſhare them betwixt them, except we prevent it by a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance.
<pb facs="tcp:56430:44"/>And what a miſerable condition we ſhall then be in, even worſe than if we were under either of them, I have formerly declared. Seeing then we are ſo degenerate, and become like <hi>Iſſachar,</hi> which his Father ſtiles a <hi>Strong Aſs,</hi> and ſays of him, that <hi>He ſaw that reſt was good,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Gen.</hi> 49.14, 15.</note> and the land that it was pleaſant; and bowed his ſhoulder to bear, and became a ſervant unto tribute:</hi> we muſt either take courage and be unanimous, valiantly fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it out with our enemies; or for the preſent be contented with this cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter and condition. Will we then fight for our <hi>Religion, Liberty, Country, Families, Eſtates, Trade?</hi> or will we not? If the former, let me encourage all in the words of <hi>Joab</hi> that great General and brave Souldier wherewith he encouraged the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> when he had his enemies before and behind him, <hi>Be of good courage, and let us play the men for our people and for the Cities of our God: and the Lord do that which ſeemeth him good.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 10.12.</note> But if the reſt be ſo <hi>good,</hi> and <hi>the Land ſo pleaſant</hi> to us, that we will rather <hi>how our ſhoulders, and become ſervants,</hi> than ſhew our faces in the field to fight with our enemies, let us ſee what <hi>Maſter</hi> we ſhould chuſe, and agree with him upon the beſt terms we can.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Therefore, ſhall we comply with both our enemies? ſurely if reaſon, and what we can give, will ſatisfie them; every wiſe man will ſay <hi>Yes,</hi> that we may enjoy the many bleſſings God hath given us in peace. But if they will have ſuch <hi>Cities,</hi> ſuch <hi>vaſt ſums of money,</hi> and ſuch <hi>Conditions,</hi> as we cannot give them, except we be ruined thereby; who will not ſay, <hi>No.</hi> We muſt therefore conſider if there be no other way practicable, to ſave our ſelves, from the devouring Sword of our Enemies.</p>
               <p n="3">3. There is no way therefore left us, but to comply with one of our Enemies, if we can poſſibly; that ſo we may ballance the others power, and either compel him to a peace, or be enabled to continue the War. If any one know any other way, I heartily wiſh he would ſhew it, as I think he is bound to do one way or other; for every one ought to contribute his beſt aſſiſtance, even by the principles of ſelf-preſervation.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 9.15, 16.</note> And <hi>Solomon</hi> tells us, <hi>There was a poor wiſe man, who by his wiſdom delivered the City, though no man remembred him,</hi> and infers thence, <hi>that wiſdom is better than ſtrength, though the poor mans wiſdom is deſpiſed, and his words are not heard.</hi> Yet ſurely notwithſtanding that poor man did but do his duty; though he was but poorly requited for his pains.</p>
               <p>But I believe moſt will grant the way is good, but impracticable, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the League betwixt the two Crowns, and that they will not treat aſunder, &amp;c. Well then, let us proceed to conſider theſe things a little, and ſee whether we cannot level theſe mountains of difficulties that are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us, and make our way become plain and paſſable.</p>
               <p n="1">1. With which of theſe our Enemies we ſhould chuſe to comply, I think I have made ſufficiently apparent; in ſhewing it our <hi>Intereſt</hi> rather to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>England</hi> than <hi>France,</hi> and to have peace and correſpondent friendſhip for our Sea-traffick, with the former rather than with the latter, if we
<pb facs="tcp:56430:45"/>cannot have it from them both. And I am ſure this was the wiſdom of our Anceſtors, who in their low condition A.D. 1575. deliberating into whoſe Protection they ſhould give themſelves over, firſt declared the Empire, and the competition coming between the Crowns of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>France</hi> prefer'd the former upon many and weighty conſiderations,<note place="margin">Cambden Annales Eliſabethae A. <hi>1575.</hi> Thuanus l. <hi>60.</hi> Caſus <hi>20.</hi>

               <p n="2">2. Seeing then we muſt chuſe <hi>England,</hi> not only for the Common Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt of the Proteſtant Religion, but for our own greateſt both religious, and civil concernments. We ſhall now remove thoſe obſtructions that ſeem to block up our way to Compliance.</p>
               <p>It is objected that the two Crowns are in a League, that neither will treat without the other, and how can we then comply with <hi>England</hi> alone?</p>
               <p>I confeſs if all Stateſmen were <hi>Ariſtides</hi>'s,<note place="margin">Plutarch. in vita Ariſtid.</note> the Argument might be ſtrong. For he having heard by command of the <hi>Athenian Senate, Themiſtocles</hi>'s deſign of burning their enimies Fleet, made report, <hi>that it was very profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, but no ways honeſt,</hi> upon which it was rejected. Or if they were all <hi>Stoicks,</hi> and held that <hi>honeſty, equity,</hi> and <hi>utility</hi> were all one, and with good old <hi>Socrates</hi> curſed thoſe that firſt ſeparated theſe, as learned men tell us. But we ſee it is far otherwiſe now in the World;<note place="margin">Plutarch. l. <hi>4.</hi> Sympoſ. Cicer. <hi>3.</hi> Offic. &amp; <hi>1.</hi> de Leg.</note> and that the <hi>Peripateticks</hi> doctrine that <hi>honeſtum</hi> and <hi>utile</hi> are really diſtinguiſhed, is every where pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent, and no where more, than amongſt <hi>Politicians;</hi> which hath occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned that known ſaying, <hi>that all States are Atheiſts.</hi> I do not approve any, and much leſs ſo high uncharitableneſs; but this I will ſay, that as the world goes now, <hi>all States muſt be conſidered as Gameſters.</hi> And what if I ſhould ſay, that neither of the Courts are ſo ſtrait laced in their Conſciences, but were they aſſured from us of ſuch conditions as they require, they would let the other go and get theirs as they could? Nay what if I ſhould ſay, there may be none iniquity in this? If I ſhould, I think I can prove it, for if in mutual covenants, either ſide do that, which is a breach; it is folly
<pb facs="tcp:56430:45"/>to think, that the innocent ſhould be bound, and the peccant party free, which they may know, though others do not, as it is clear in the ſtrongeſt covenant, that is in the World, I mean that of wedlock. I do not ſay that this is ſo betwixt them, but I ſay it may be ſo though we do not know it, ſo that either of them in ſuch caſe, may conclude with us. And I am ſure it is no diſhoneſty on our part.</p>
               <p>But it will here be ſaid, they will not.</p>
               <p>Do not tell me that, I know they either of them will. And if any one asks me, how? and if I be of their Cabinet Council? I ſhall only ſmile, perceiving they do not know me. I am far from that, or having ever to do with Kings or States in that kind, or pragmatically trinketing with State affairs, it being a Rule which I live by, <hi>never to ask great men mercy.</hi> Common favour and juſtice I deſire of men, but mercy only of my God. And yet I know this very well, and I will tell you how, and that is from their <hi>Intereſt;</hi> which is the compaſs, by which all States-men ſteer their courſe, and may be diſcerned by a skilful paſſenger, although he ſit not at the helm. If any man be ſo ignorant of the affairs of the World, as to think that States-men trouble their heads with the <hi>Scool-mens quiddities,</hi> and <hi>haeccieties,</hi> or their conſciences with <hi>Caſuiſticall nicities,</hi> as a late <hi>German Divine</hi> that puts the caſe, whether we ſhould pray <hi>Vader onſe,</hi> or <hi>Onſe Vader,</hi> and learnedly concludes that cuſtom muſt carry it; let him enjoy his opinion, it is very charitable, and can do no hurt. But yet I may ſay, that for above 20 years I have obſerved, that the cuſtom of the World carries it with them, and have known few, I had almoſt ſaid none, of the ſtricteſt Sect of the <hi>Phariſees;</hi> though I have ſome, and my charity obliges me to hope there are many, that ſeriouſly mind the <hi>weightier things of the Law, juſtice, righteouſnes, temperance, and the World to come.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now that this is the Intereſt of both the Kings, rather to deal with us apart, than jointly, as well as ours, I could many ways make apparent. But ſeeing it is our intereſt to chuſe <hi>England</hi> we ſhall prove only that it is theirs to comply with us; omitting that of <hi>France,</hi> as ſuperfluous to our purpoſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. They know they cannot wholly conquer us themſelves. Not only in regard of our own ſtrength, of which I haven ſpoken before, but the <hi>French,</hi> which are in the Country already, and if they were not, would never permit it, as I have formerly ſhown ſufficiently. Nay I dare ſay, they never deſigned any ſuch thing, becauſe they know it is impracticable: that being always true of the Greeks, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> or things im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible come not into conſideration. I doubt not but they both intend and hope to have their ſhare, what ever it is that is agreed upon between the two Crowns, in caſe of Conqueſt; but that they ſhould have the whole, could never ſo much as be dreamt of by them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. They know alſo that it is their intereſt, never to ſuffer <hi>France</hi> have all, no nor any of theſe Maritime Provinces. If he have ſome of the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior,
<pb facs="tcp:56430:46"/>that is the utmoſt their intereſt can permit. Nay indeed he is nearer theſe inferior, than that will allow, if they could help it, but that's now paſt. What vaſt diſadvantage it will be to the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> to let <hi>France</hi> have footing upon our Coaſts, and ſo come to cope with them at Sea, I have formerly ſhown: and I know they are very ſenſible of it; and therefore may well infer a willingneſs on their parts to a compliance.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The <hi>Prince of Orange</hi> his intereſt being alſo theirs, cannot but ſway ſomething with them. For if it had been Gods will, thoſe Kingdoms had continued in peace, and the ſucceſſion of the Royal reign uninterrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted there, and the <hi>Orange</hi> family continued alive and in power here, I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade my ſelf we ſhould never have warred with one another; ſo I doubt not, if it pleaſe God to preſerve his Highneſs, that they may confide more in our friendſhip, than they could formerly, he will be a happy Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a better underſtanding between the Nations, when theſe unhappy quarrels come once to be compoſed; becauſe this is their intereſt as well as ours, and it is intereſt that rules and reigns in the World.</p>
               <p>And thus I have ſhewn you that we <hi>may,</hi> I ſhall now ſhew briefly that we <hi>muſt comply</hi> with them, or without a miracle of mercy we are ruined.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe if the War continues, and we be too weak to make ſtrong reſiſtance, ſo that our enemies prevail; they will ſhare the Country be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt them, and then we fall into the worſt condition, that can poſſibly befal us. It is true, I foreſee that ſeveral particular Perſons may ſave themſelves and their eſtates, by friends on the one ſide or the other; but I ſpeak of the community; and it is well if the hopes many have of that, make them not more negligent for this. There are two famous Republicks in <hi>Italy, Venice</hi> and <hi>Genoa;</hi> and what is the cauſe of the formers flouriſhing ſo much more than the latter, which was anciently both their better and their Maſter? but this, that the <hi>Venetians</hi> are more intent upon the Publick, and the <hi>Genoeſe</hi> upon their private concernments: whereby they become obnoxious not only to many factions among themſelves, but alſo to oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions from their Neighbours. I could ſay more herein of our ſelves, than I ſhall at preſent, in regard it might create more jealouſies (which are already too many) of thoſe that are, or at leaſt have been, in Government amongſt us. But though I will accuſe none, yet I muſt needs ſay, that I aſcribe a great part of our preſent miſeries to this <hi>Genoan</hi> practice; and heartily wiſh, this prove not fatal to us at laſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Becauſe if we be not ſenſeleſs we may clearly ſee, that <hi>France's</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign is abſolutely to conquer us: whereas <hi>England</hi> ſeeks only (to uſe their expreſſion) their own ſecurity. And therefore in my Logick the inference is plain, that we had better part with ſomething, than loſe all, as we are like to do, if we come not to a compliance with <hi>England.</hi> To make theſe apparent to any wiſe man, would be the lighting a Torch to the Sun. Although I know the quite contrary is caſt out among us by the friends of <hi>France,</hi> who would perſwade us, that the <hi>French</hi> ſeek only to humble
<pb facs="tcp:56430:46"/>us, and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> to conquer us. But we know the minding of men, is but ſhooting at random, and that he that means to come near the truth, muſt have his eye upon the <hi>mark of intereſt,</hi> which cannot lye, as men do frequently for it. If any be ſo fooliſh, as to be enchanted with ſuch <hi>Syrens</hi> ſongs, as are daily ſung amongſt us; and have more regard to publick news, than the intereſt of Nations; they may go on, I cannot hinder them: but let me tell them, that I fear they will find at laſt, the Poets fiction a real truth; and if they ſtear their own courſe, meet with the Seamens fate in the Fable, be ſung a ſleep for a time, that ſo they may be afterwards, with greater facility drowned and devoured.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Becauſe there is no other way or humane means leſt us (ſo far as I can diſcern) of the Common-wealths continuation. And this is the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion that follows clearly from the premiſes. For if we be unable to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand them both, or ſatisfie them both, we muſt either break their confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deracy, and have the help of one of them, or the Republick will be ruined.</p>
               <p>It will here be demanded, ſeeing it is both <hi>Englands</hi> intereſt and our own to accord, why do we not then come to a compliance.</p>
               <p>I will tell you why. Becauſe we judge our Condition better, and they judge it worſe, than really it is; and therefore ſtand upon greater terms, than we will give them. We think things will go better with us in time, and they think they will grow worſe. We flatter our ſelves with vain hopes, and rely upon <hi>Brandenburgs</hi> Aſſiſtance, <hi>Spains</hi> breaking with our enemies, the <hi>Parliament of Englands</hi> not ſupplying that King to carry on the War, and the like, when they know the quite contrary in all humane appearance. <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>or perhaps we are afraid to irritate <hi>France,</hi> if we ſhould make overtures to <hi>England;</hi> and <hi>England</hi> will not give ſuch an umbrage of jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie to <hi>France,</hi> as to tamper with us, except they be firſt aſſured from us of ſatisfaction. But cannot the effecting this be put into the hands of his <hi>Highneſs</hi> and a few others as it was lately, to be privately tranſacted by them? Here then it is that the ſhooe pinches, We are a popular State, the people ſtill think, till an enemy comes, they can defend themſelves, and therefore our Governors dare not adventure to tender <hi>England</hi> ſuch ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, as (for ought I ſee) they will have; leſt they either ſhould not be able to perform it, or if they do, ſhould loſe themſelves with the people. And therefore I foreſee, the War will be continued, till we be reduced to that condition, that we ſhall be neceſſitated to give them both their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, by publick tranſaction, or at leaſt that way break with one of them. And on this foundation, I ſhall now proceed, to gueſs at that which I think is moſt likely to befal us.</p>

Beſides the incredible preparations of <hi>France,</hi> is not <hi>England, Sweadland,</hi> and all our Neighbors allmoſt up and at worke; and can we thinke they would be at that coſt for a Comedy of Peace? have we not all the reaſon in the World, to thinke it will be to us, a Tragedy of War? Let others enjoy their opinion, and not take the alarme, till they ſee <hi>Hanibal ad portas;</hi> for my part, I muſt needs profes, I cannot, from what I obſerve, but conclude, that the affaires of the enſuing Summer, are like to be great, and the motions thereof quick, and ſuch as will highly concerne us in theſe Countreys.</p>
               <p>As to this Republick, which hath at this time theſe four declared Enimies, <hi>England, France, Colen,</hi> and <hi>Munſter;</hi> I ſhall briefly ſpeake my thoughts, with reference to them all.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>England</hi> probably will get, <hi>a bridle to curb us.</hi> I have ſhewne in the <hi>Preface,</hi> what they account the <hi>Intreſt</hi> of the Kingdome: We ſee notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the <hi>Prince of Orange</hi> his promotion, they ſtill purſue the War; and muſt we not then conclude, that they ſeeke ſome thing further? Whether they will by Sea attacque our Coaſts, or by marching their Armie about over Land, is not for me to determine; much les what particular places below they may fall upon, or what ſucces they may have. Yet I conclude they will have ſome hanke or other upon our Navall power, one way or other, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they make Peace with us; otherwiſe they will continue the War the following Summer, to try their utmoſt to get, that which we will not give them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>France</hi> that is allready got into the Sadle, will there ſit and ride us; though we flatter our ſelves, we ſhall by one means or other, ſhake him out of it, and off our backs. Truly I cannot but wonder often times, to heare what vaine hopes men expres and there's no contradicting them; (allthough ſome times I cannot conteine my ſelfe from ſmiling, or ſhakeing my head) that <hi>France</hi> muſt be content with one or two of our Cities which we can beſt ſpare, and with a confidence allmoſt as large, as if they was ready to run way, or reſolved to march out and quit thoſe Cities they have, at our pleaſure. As if the <hi>French</hi> were ſuch ſooles, to be at that vaſt expence, great paines, even the King himſelfe perſonally, and have
<pb facs="tcp:56430:48"/>ſuch advantage upon us, and quit the ſame for a thing of nothing? For my part, I am affraid they will rather get more, then loſe that they have gotten already. And I know, their deſigne is, to get all at laſt. It is true, if we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with <hi>England,</hi> and ſo ſtrengthen our ſelves by them and <hi>Spaine,</hi> we may thereby hope either to obteine better conditions by Treaty, or compel them thereunto by Force. But I am ſpeaking of the ſtate of the War, as now it ſtands.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Colen,</hi> that pretends to ſome of thoſe Cities which we held about the <hi>Rhyne,</hi> that are now in the power and poſſeſſion of the <hi>French,</hi> may poſſibly for his paines, and permiſſion of their paſſage, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> get ſome <hi>ſupernumerary girth,</hi> one place or other that may be of no great concernment to <hi>France,</hi> either for their deſignes upon us or the Empire, and muſt be contented there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with. And perhaps for ſome time his Counſellors may have their Penſions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued from <hi>France.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Munſter,</hi> that is mercinary and fights for Money, will get a bos off the crupper; <hi>French Lewis</hi>'s made and minted of <hi>Dutch Ducats.</hi> For elective <hi>Princes,</hi> as <hi>Biſhops,</hi> that are onely for life, ſeek more to enrich themſelves, then to enlarge their Territories, as thoſe doe that are hereditary.</p>
               <p>And this is likely, ſo far as I can ſee, to prove our condition; except <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> appeare in the Tragedy, or God Almighty by ſome wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full providence, make a change in the Scene of this War. Which, I confeſs, is very deplorable, which way ſoever we look; and we are not ſo ſenſible of it now, as we ſhall be hereafter. I had thought here to have ſit downe a little with a lamentation, but I have been ſo large already, that I ſhall wholly wave it for the preſent.</p>
               <p>And yet <hi>it is a had wind that blows no good,</hi> we may make this advantage of our miſeries, ſo long as we remain amidſt our enimies, when a Peace is once concluded; that we may hold them both fair to us, and ſo ſecure our ſelves a little more in quiet, then we perhaps think, by being ready to cloſe with either, to the great prejudice of the other.</p>
               <p>And therefore let me freely inſert this important and neceſſary Caution for <hi>England, That they take heed they do not overdo their work;</hi> and ſo far irritate this Republick, that out of a preſent prejudice and paſſion, and alſo deſpera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their future quietneſs from them, they call in the <hi>French,</hi> to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venged of them, though it be to their own ruine.</p>
               <p>I know many are jealous, that this whole War is onely to make the <hi>Prince of Orange</hi> a <hi>Monarch,</hi> and the two Crowns will have no more to do with the States; although I profeſs, I am far from thinking, that thoſe two Kings and Kingdoms would be at all this expence of blood and treaſure for that end onely, and doe believe that if that would ſet us in our former condition, it would ſoone be aſſented unto, not onely by the multitude, but the wiſeft men amongſt us, who know the extraordinary abilities and great capacities of his Highneſs. Therefore let me ſay it freely without offence, either of Him or his Enimies, that I perceive many lay this for a
<pb facs="tcp:56430:48"/>fundamental maxim, <hi>Better a Prince that hath power to defend us, then one whom we muſt onely defend.</hi> And except my eye-ſight fail me, ſome are faſt at work in preparing materials to build thereon. A word is enough to the wiſe, and therefore I will ſay no more.</p>
               <p>Nay I will not diſſemble my further fears, That if <hi>France</hi> keeps thoſe places on the South Sea, and ſhould get others lower, either in <hi>Holland</hi> or <hi>Frieſlands,</hi> as may capacitate him to incommodate their Trade, though we ſhould have a peace for ſome time with him, we ſhall fall into his hands at laſt. For the <hi>French</hi> are already ſo near us on every ſide, that they hover over us, as a Hawk over the grey, watching onely an opportunity, how they may graſp us in their talons.</p>
               <p>If any ſhall here aske me, Why may we not then as well now become <hi>French?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I alſo ſhall aske ſuch one Queſtion, which when they ſatisfie me in, I alſo ſhall them. You know certainly you muſt die at laſt, (whereas here is onely uncertaine fears) and yet when you are ſick, why do you take phyſick and uſe means for recovery? Is it not becauſe you deſire to live as long as you can? Doe you not account him a mad man, that will caſt away his life, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he muſt loſe it at the laſt? And rightly, becauſe who knows what God may doe, and whether he may not recover him, though the diſeaſe be deſperate?</p>
               <p>Having ſpoke our thoughts concerning theſe united, we ſhall now ſpeak of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Provinces. I have as much ſmattering skill in Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick, I confeſs, as would ſerve me to make <hi>Charon</hi> a fraight of old Wives; yet am I far from being arrived at the confidence, which I have obſerved in <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rinal-Doctors.</hi> And yet for once, I will adventure to try the little skill I have, with thoſe <hi>State-Mountebanks,</hi> that are ſo ſecure concerning the <hi>Spaniſh Netherlands.</hi> For my part, I have ſhak't their Water again and again, and can find nothing but ſymptoms of death. I ſhall onely premiſe that I ſhall not with an Emperical confidence tell you the time: Kingdoms and States, as well as private perſons, ſometimes languiſh out rather then live their laſt. But that they are ſo ſick, that I ſee no hopes of their reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very if this War continues. And I will tell you my feares for the enſuing Summer.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The incredible preparations that <hi>France</hi> makes this Winter, both of Men and Money, as if they would ſet all at ſtake for carrying on the following Summers Wars.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Empire's Army is overmatcht with <hi>Turens.</hi> They know, that we are not in a capacity to recover the Cities we have loſt, and that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not conquer thoſe that remaine; ſo that their Armies cannot be deſigned either for ſtrengthning their owne Garriſons, or forcing of ours. Except they will ſpend a Summers Expedition upon ſome inconſiderable out Garriſons, which I cannot imagin.</p>
               <p n="3">3. I have looked round about in <hi>Europe,</hi> where this ſtorme ſhould fall,
<pb facs="tcp:56430:49"/>and can ſee no place it hovers over, except thoſe Provinces, and our ſelves.</p>
               <p n="4">4. I conſider the eminent advantage <hi>France</hi> hath at preſent by their friendſhip with <hi>England;</hi> which I feare he will take.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Allthough I doe not thinke <hi>France</hi> will prevaile by all his endeavors with <hi>England</hi> to breake with <hi>Spaine;</hi> yet I thinke <hi>England</hi> will either be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in doing their owne worke, or not ſo quickly breake with <hi>France,</hi> to ſtop his carriere in over-running thoſe <hi>Netherlands.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6 We ſhall either have the Wars continue, or a Peace. If the former as they are, though <hi>England</hi> helps not therein, (for they profes in their Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration to maintaine the Treaty at <hi>Aken</hi>) yea, though they would hinder it, yet I doe not ſee how they can practically, if they have not prevented it before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand by their Treaty; nor we to be ſure the Wars continuing. If a Peace be concluded, we ſhall be forced to forſake them; this being the main ground of the quarrel. For if we would have helped <hi>France</hi> to have ruind them, we might have been quiet for ſome time at leaſt; but becauſe we had rather quench, then ſet our neighbors houſe on fire, leſt ours follow in the flames: <hi>France</hi> hath fallen upon us, and ſhall we not then thinke that he will cudgell us into ſuch conditions? It is true indeed, if <hi>England</hi> and we come to underſtand one another, and our joynt intreſt better; we may ſuccor them for ſome time; but that's not my ſuppoſal, of the Wars continuing as they are, which in that caſe implies a ſtrange complication of diſeaſes, which to me, who knows not their Treaty, ſeems incurable.</p>
               <p n="7">7. And where elſe they ſhould have aſſiſtance to ſave them, if <hi>France</hi> will fall upon them, I ſee not. For the Empire cannot, it is well if they can ſave themſelves. <hi>Spaine</hi> is at a great diſtance. May make perhaps ſome diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in <hi>Catalonia,</hi> or ſome ſmall from <hi>Millan, &amp;c.</hi> But whats that to ſave thoſe Provinces?</p>
               <p n="8">8. We muſt therefore conſider if they can ſtand on their owne legs, ſo as to withſtand their enimies power, and not to be throwne downe thereby. And here we ſhall find the number of <hi>Spaniſh</hi> inconſiderable; the <hi>Dutch</hi> very wavering and uncertaine: Some Popiſh Zealots thinking <hi>France</hi> can beſt carry on their deſignes; others betwixt hopes and feares, wiſhing they might ſee an iſſue; and others plainely deſpairing of reſiſtance, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring they were over. Their Cities great and untenable, ſeverall of them requiring allmoſt as many to man them well, as they have <hi>Spaniſh</hi> in the Countrey. If they can make good <hi>Bruxels, Antwerp, Namur,</hi> and <hi>Ooſtend,</hi> for ſome time, to ſee if the affaires of <hi>Europe</hi> may not alter, it is all I expect. But what ſhall become of the whole Countrey, and the reſt of the Cities,<note place="margin">Deſcriptio Lovani.</note> 
                  <hi>Bruges, Mechlin, Gant, Lovaine, &amp;c.</hi> Some of them as large as moſt Cities in <hi>Europe.</hi> Three Noblemen <hi>An.</hi> 1427. (as <hi>Guicciardine</hi> tells us) with great charges, had five of the greateſt Cities on this ſide the Alpes meaſured, and found but, 18 Rods or Perches difference. Of which <hi>Lovaine</hi> and <hi>Gant,</hi> the greateſt; <hi>Paris</hi> (within the Walls) and <hi>Liege</hi> alike; <hi>Colen</hi> the leaſt. But neglecting to mention the juſt meaſure, <hi>Guicciardine</hi> tells us they
<pb facs="tcp:56430:49"/>are 6 <hi>Italian</hi> miles within, and above 8 without the walls. And though this be enough, yet I muſt needs thinke them more. For having had the curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity to meaſure one of them for all, I found it upon a warme walking within the Walls, three full hours by my watch. And beſides this, <hi>Paris</hi> and <hi>Liege</hi> are moſt populous, <hi>Colen</hi> next, but theſe of the <hi>Netherlands</hi> leaſt, ſo that I leave any rationall man to judge what number of men they require to maintaine them, for I will not now ſtand to make that calculation. Now if he takes theſe two great Cities, he is in the heart of <hi>Brabant</hi> and <hi>Flanders,</hi> ſo that all the reſt will fall of themſelves. I conclude therfore, that except the treaty between <hi>France</hi> and <hi>England</hi> ſecure them, which is unknowne to me; or that God in his all-wiſe Providence, make ſome wonderfull chang in the ſcene of affairs in Europe, the <hi>Spaniſh Netherlands</hi> are loſt. Having therefore thus tolled their paſſing bell, we will leave them to Gods mercy, and the King of <hi>France</hi>'s clemency, and haſt us out of them to <hi>France</hi> and <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And here many perhaps will thinke me litle better than madd, to croſs the current opinion of Chriſtendom; when I ſay that the <hi>Friendſhip of France and England is ſick at heart, and cannot live long;</hi> and the contrary of that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twene <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Spaine.</hi> But I matter not that, other men have their way of making their meaſures, and I have mine. And indeed I thought to have communicated it, but this worke having allready exceeded my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions, and that would be a great digreſſion, I would onely tell you my grounds or reaſons for the preſent why I thinke ſo, and may happily make a particular diſcourſe of the other hereafter.</p>
               <p>How <hi>France</hi> and <hi>England</hi> came to be ſo great friends as to agree to commence, and carry on a War thus far againſt us, is not now mine enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; but to ſhew there is no ſuch ground to diſpaire of complianee with <hi>England,</hi> notwithſtanding their preſent league with <hi>France,</hi> is my deſigne. And for this end I ſhall firſt ſhew that though this friendſhip is faire out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly, each for their own ends; yet that it is not ſo cordiall and firme, as many amongſt us feare it is. And to ſay the truth, the conſideration hereof, was the firſt dawning of hopes I had, for the Proteſtant Intreſt, and the good of theſe Countries. Now allthough I could mention ſome more private expoſtulations, and perhaps ſome of their Articles, allthough I could by no means, ever procure from either ſide, the knowledge of them all: yet I thinke it not fit to mention theſe, but ſuch things onely as are publick, and others as well as my ſelf may know, if they uſe their eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight, and obſervation.</p>
               <p>Let us then omitting all ſecrets and myſteries of State, which yet are the beſt grounds to make a judgement, when certainely knowne; we will onely mention ſuch things as are publickly apparent, but being not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered in ſubordination to Reaſons of State, were unuſefull to the moſt, for the end I have obſerved them.</p>
               <p>When all <hi>Europe</hi> ſtood in doubt what <hi>England</hi> would doe, and all men on
<pb facs="tcp:56430:50"/>their tiptoes with expectation; to ſee whether War or Peace, betwixt that Kingdome and theſe Countries: upon the <hi>Smyrna</hi>'s Fleet returne, the doubts of many were then decided. The Saturday morning early after the fight, the <hi>Fiſcale</hi> ſent his footman to tell me they had fought, with ſome generalls thereof, and that the Fleet was before the Land: I muſt confes, I ſtood amazed at <hi>Holmes</hi>'s furious folly, who had orders onely to bring them up, not to commence a War, the Declaration thereof being not publiſhed; allthough to thoſe that would not ſubmit to ſuch orders, it was all one in effect, though not in formalities, which are the greateſt plea, that I know of, that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> have for that Action. Upon this I began to conſider the Reaſons of State as to <hi>England,</hi> both domeſtick and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign; For I reaſoned thus, if this friendſhip be ſo firme that <hi>England</hi> will goe through with <hi>France</hi> in all their great deſignes, I muſt make other mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures then I had formerly done. But ſtill finding all Reaſons of State againſt this, and thoſe jealouſies of changing <hi>Religion</hi> and the <hi>Government</hi> in thoſe Kingdoms frivolous, (as I have demonſtrated) I found allſo thereby ſtronger grounds of hope for the Proteſtant Religion and the common In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſt of <hi>Europe;</hi> and that it was onely a temporary friendſhip, out of ſome particular peake, or deſigne againſt theſe Provinces, which would have an end when ſatisfaction therein was given to that Crowne. Whilſt I am buſy in ballancing all the Reaſons of State for thoſe Kingdoms, and likewiſe for their Intreſt abroad as comprehenſively as I could, the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants Intreſt, the Triple Alliance, the greatnes of <hi>France,</hi> the danger of <hi>England &amp;c.</hi> comes the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Declaration of War to mine hands, but without a particular date, contrary to practiſe, but wiſely to colour what <hi>Holmes</hi> had done. Which having diligently peruſed, what I deſired firſt to ſee, I found laſt to my great ſatisfaction, and that is that they would <hi>ſupport the peace made at Aix la Chappelle,</hi> (or <hi>Aken</hi>) <hi>and notwithſtanding the proſecution of this War, will maintaine the true intent and ſcope of the ſaid Treaty, and that in all their Alliances which they have or ſhall make in the progres of this War, they have and will take care, to preſerve the ends thereof inviolable unles pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked to the contrary.</hi> Whereby I was fully confirmed in my former opinion, ſo that I will now proceed to relate ſuch things which have publickly paſt in the management of this War, that are ſufficient I thinke to enduce thoſe that are unprejudiced, though perhaps not to convince the obſtinate, to be of the ſame opinion with my ſelfe, and that the friendſhip of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>France</hi> is not ſo firme as they have feared. Premiſing that though all States as Gameſters muſt and will be cautious in their playing their parts, yet there appeared ſtill more then ordinary jealouſies of each others friendſhip all along, in the management of this War.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is obſerveable that though <hi>France</hi> is the Principall in the War, yet they were ſo diffident of <hi>England,</hi> that they would have them firſt to begin it, that ſo they might ſee them certainly engaged againſt us.</p>
               <p n="2">2. When they are both engaged, they truſt not one another, without
<pb facs="tcp:56430:50"/>great <hi>Hoſtages</hi> as it were on both ſides; the <hi>French</hi> Squadron of Ships with the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and the <hi>Duke of Monmouth</hi> with the body of an Army with the <hi>French.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. That body of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> which doubtles ſhould have remained to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether under their owne generall Officers conjoyned with the <hi>French</hi> Armie; we know was not truſted by the <hi>French</hi> ſo to doe, but were mingled here and there, under the principall command of the <hi>French</hi> Generalls.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The Fleet wherein the <hi>Engliſh</hi> had the principall ſhare of power and command, onely faced ours at firſt in point of Honour, yet attacqued them not, though they had the wind, whereby they might eaſily have done it at their pleaſure, and alſo to their Advantage; but ſtood over againe to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> coaſt. Which fooles thought was want of valour, but wiſe men will judge it reaſon of State, that they might ſtay and obſerve what ſucces the <hi>French</hi> had by Land. And had not we fallen upon them, for Reaſons of State in thoſe circumſtances and Government of theſe Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, that are well knowne, I thinke they would have done, as litle as they could for <hi>France;</hi> to have fought us to this day.</p>
               <p n="5">5. After that fight, though they knew ſeverall of our Ships were laid up, and ſome thouſands of men called out of the Fleet, yet notwithſtanding all the Summer after for many weeks, they attempted nothing againſt us with their Fleet. Intending doubtles to doe their owne worke, as they then ſaw <hi>France</hi> did theirs.</p>
               <p n="6">6. How the <hi>Engliſh</hi> were ſtartled, at the <hi>French</hi>'s coming to <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>trecht</hi> was very apparent, which we have formerly mentioned.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Why might not <hi>England,</hi> as well as the reſt of the World, thinke that <hi>Weſel, Rijnberg, Skenker-ſconſe,</hi> and the reſt of our ſtrong out Garriſons might give the <hi>French</hi> ſufficient worke? and the <hi>French</hi> on the contrary, who had laid their traines before hand, know that when they came to fire them, there was no feare they would mis, and they ſhould faile of having thoſe places? Yea why may they not deſigne by this meanes to breake both our powers ſo by Sea, that they may riſe up to contend with either of us? I am ſure theſe things are very uſuall with Princes and States, and exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of this kind are infinite. Why may we not then thinke that <hi>England</hi> might hereby deſigne to breake <hi>France</hi>'s power by Land; and <hi>France Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands</hi> power and ours alſo by Sea? How often theſe two Crowns have played ſuch like games with one another formerly; when <hi>England</hi> had ſooting in <hi>France,</hi> is apparent from the Hiſtories of both Nations. But we will ſpeake of that which more nearly concerns our ſelves, and within our own knowledge. In our firſt War with <hi>England</hi> I obſerved, what influence <hi>Don Alonzo,</hi> the Reſident for <hi>Spaine</hi> at <hi>London,</hi> had, to fomer thoſe jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſies that that Common-wealth had of this, that it was the Kings cauſe, which this Republick by meanes of the <hi>Orange</hi> Family had eſpou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and what aſſiſtance <hi>Spaine,</hi> (which firſt publickly acknowledged that Common-weath) would afford them, &amp;c. And when we were both en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged,
<pb facs="tcp:56430:51"/>how the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> drew their Forces towards our Frontiers, as if they alſo would fall upon us; and when we declined, withdrew them againe, to encourage us both to continue the War. And in our ſecond War, if <hi>France</hi> had not a great hand both in contriving and continuing it, wiſemen are much deceived, and the French miſrepreſented to the World. By what inducements they perſwaded both ſides to a willingnes to that War, I liſt not mention, nor is there much neceſſity thereof, they being ſo well knowne to ſeverall of both Nations. What a hand they had in its continuation, we may eaſily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, if we recollect but what paſſed therein. When the <hi>Engliſh</hi> in the firſt Battel had bearen us, <hi>France</hi> being onely a <hi>Spectator</hi> to ballance <hi>England,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes our Second; and <hi>Monſieur,</hi> the Kings onely Brother, and his Lady, <hi>Englands</hi> onely Siſter, were not permitted to uſe any publick expreſſions of joy by Bonefires, or otherwiſe for their Brother the <hi>Duke of Yorks</hi> Victory over <hi>Opdam.</hi> Their Fleet under <hi>de Duke of Bauford</hi> ſhall come to our aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, which occaſiond the dividing of the <hi>Engliſhe</hi>'s, by which meanes and <hi>Monks</hi> precipitancy (who would needs fight contrary to the advice of the cheif and beſt Commanders in the Fleet, as <hi>Aſcough</hi> told us in the <hi>Hague</hi>) the <hi>Engliſh</hi> are beaten by us. And to boye up <hi>England</hi> againe, a private League is made betweene the two Crownes, as I have formerly declared from an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Author. So that theſe tricks of State are uſuall, though not diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by every eye; nor dare I cenſure them allwayes for ſinfull, except I ſee manifeſtly foule play, becauſe I know not the Reaſons of State, which are the Grounds of their proceedings.</p>
               <p>Having thus ſhewne, and I thinke ſufficiently, <hi>that the friendſhip of</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land <hi>and</hi> France <hi>is ſick at heart;</hi> I ſhall now proceed to ſhew, <hi>that it cannot live long;</hi> but if <hi>France</hi> goes on, <hi>will and muſt die quickly.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Englands</hi> intreſt will perſwade them to this, which they cannot but diſcerne clearly prompts them to put a ſtop to <hi>France</hi>'s progres. If any think that they are ſo blinded with Paſſion, That to be revenged of us, they will ruin themſelves: I am not of their opinion, for many Reaſons, which I think I am cleare in; allthough I ſhall not mention them now, but onely appeale to the iſſue, whether they or I be in the darke and deceived.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The many tricks that <hi>France</hi> playes them, ſome whereof I have hint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and ſeverall others might be mentioned, That I know they have attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but been diſappointed in; cannot but alienate the <hi>Engliſh</hi> from them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. A Treaty being the game (as I have ſaid) we ſhall play at, (which the ſooner and better for us) I foreſee plainly, that ſuch Cards will be played, as will make it apparent, that the Pack was neither fairly ſhuffled nor delt, and that the <hi>French</hi> meane to play at <hi>la bete</hi> with us both; and if we continue to play, ſhall come to <hi>loſ<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="4">4. If <hi>England</hi> come to receive ſatisfaction, the ſpirit of the Nation will
<pb facs="tcp:56430:51"/>turne the ſcales. For ſuppoſe that ſhould be now,<note place="margin">

               <p n="5">5. The Neceſſity of keeping up the ballance between <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spaine,</hi> will neceſſitate <hi>England</hi> to breake with <hi>France,</hi> or at leaſt hold them to keepe more within their bounds, as we ſhall more fully ſhew hereafter.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Nay the very defence of theſe Countries, which we thinke they ſeeke to ruine, will cauſe them either to bring <hi>France</hi> to a peace with us, or themſelves to help to defend us againſt them. For they will never ſuffer <hi>France</hi> to have them all, no nor the greateſt part of theſe maritime Provinces, nor the ſtrongeſt as <hi>Holland,</hi> if they can poſſibly hinder it, though they may permit them ſome part of the Superior, for having themſelves a ſhare of the Inferior, as I have formerly ſhewne. So that our <hi>intreſt</hi> is ſo far <hi>Englands,</hi> and is the greateſt ſecurity we have, next to Gods protection, and our owne ſtrength, that we ſhall not be wholly overrun and brought under the <hi>French.</hi> Yea, this is ſo highly their concernement, that I perſwade my ſelfe, if all the ſtrength of the 3 Kingdoms under the Crowne of <hi>England,</hi> and all the power of <hi>Spaine</hi> with them, can hinder it, <hi>France</hi> ſhall never gaine them; or if he doe, never quietly poſſes them.</p>
               <p>And theſe things I thinke are ſufficient, to free us from our fooliſh feares of <hi>England;</hi> and to perſwade us to a compliance with them, ſeeing we are both ſo greatly concerned to comply.</p>
               <p>We ſhall now proceed to ſhew the quite contrary of the friendſhip be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Spaine</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> that <hi>it is ſound at heart, and will recover.</hi> Wherein we need not be ſo large, becauſe that which ſhews that the friendſhip of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>England</hi> muſt die, proves that of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Spaine</hi> will live.</p>
               <p>That this friendſhip is ſound on the ſide of <hi>Spaine,</hi> none queſtions; this being the great motive, (though not the onely I confeſs) that hath kept them from breaking with <hi>France.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And that it is allſo ſo on the ſide of <hi>England,</hi> I thinke is as cleare to thoſe that conſiders.</p>

And can we thinke the King will eaſily forgoe his Cuſtoms, and the Kingdome their Commerce with thoſe Dominions? Which in my calculation, is equall with that they have with all <hi>Europe</hi> beſides.</p>
               <p n="3">3.

               <p n="4">4. <hi>England</hi> cannot but be ſenſible of the greatnes of <hi>France,</hi> and cannot be ſo ſenſeles, but they muſt needs thinke, that it is their concernement that he grow not ſo great, that he become their Maſter allſo at laſt? And the whole World knowes that <hi>Spaine</hi> not onely hath been now for many yeares the ballance for them; but ſtill muſt be ſo upon the Continent, or none: The Princes of the Empire being now ſo divided between the <hi>Imperiall</hi> and <hi>French Crowne.</hi> What wiſe man therefore can thinke now that <hi>Spaine</hi> declines, but that the <hi>Empire</hi> and <hi>England</hi> are highly concernd to ſupport them? And ſhall we thinke then that in ſtead of this, either ſhould help forwards their downfall? For my part, were there no other reaſon of ſtate,

Which Bands, they having once broke, they became at liberty to get more elbow-room in the World; and become the largeſt, compacteſt, and ſtrongeſt Kingdom of <hi>Europe,</hi> were it not that their owne inteſtine Diviſions, and frequent Civil Wars hath often weakned them.</p>
               <p>After <hi>France</hi> had arrived at this greatnes, the following Kings <hi>Charles</hi> the 8. <hi>Lewis</hi> the 12. and <hi>Francis</hi> the firſt, fruitleſly ſpent the Kingdoms ſtrength in their Wars in <hi>Italy;</hi> till <hi>Francis</hi> and <hi>Charles</hi> the 5. became com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petitors for the <hi>Empire,</hi> and <hi>Spaine</hi> and <hi>France</hi> a fit match for each other in power. Since which time ſuch mighty conteſts have been betwixt thoſe two Kingdoms, as have filled all <hi>Europe</hi> with terror and amazement, and all Hiſtorians with their Actions. But how <hi>France</hi> hath ſo far prevailed, as we ſee at preſent, is partly by our owne, and partly by the <hi>Engliſh</hi> fault; we by Commiſſion, and they by Omiſſion, as we ſhall (with what bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity
<pb facs="tcp:56430:53"/>we can) make apparent, in regard it may be uſefull to us both.</p>
               <p>During the reigne of <hi>Charles</hi> the 5. and <hi>Francis</hi> aforeſaid, the Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Religion begun, which occaſioned great alterations to the Kingdom of <hi>France,</hi> and to the Kings of <hi>Spaine</hi> in theſe <hi>Low Countries.</hi> Wherein the Crowne of <hi>Spaine</hi> continued to proſecute their intreſt, in breaking downe the power of <hi>France</hi> by all means poſſible, and eſpecially by joyning with the <hi>Guiſian faction</hi> which ſtiled themſelves the <hi>Holy-League,</hi> under pretenſe of oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the <hi>Proteſtants.</hi> Thoſe great conteſts which the ſeverall factions in <hi>France</hi> clothed with the glorious mantle of Religion, are well knowne to thoſe that are converſant in their Hiſtories, and are particularly declared by many; but beſt in my judgement, on the Proteſtants ſide by <hi>Beza,</hi> the Author (though not named) of thoſe 15 Bookes, he ſtiles <hi>Commentariorum de Statu Religionis &amp; Reip. in Regno Galliae, ſub Henrico.</hi> 2. <hi>Franciſo</hi> 2. <hi>Carolo</hi> 9. <hi>&amp; Henrico</hi> 3.

               <p>On the otherhand <hi>France</hi> was not aſleep, or awanting to proſecute their intreſt, in fomenting, promoting, and carrying on thoſe diviſions in theſe <hi>Low Countries;</hi> to breake downe the power of <hi>Spaine,</hi> into whoſe hands they had fallen by marriage (as we have ſaid) and to remove the obſtacle, which theſe Provinces conſtantly were, to their advancing their deſignes. For which end they continually aſſiſted us, and whilſt they pretended to fight our Battells; at our charges they really fought their owne. And leſt the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria</hi> ſo nearly allied to <hi>Spaine,</hi> ſhould afford them further aſſiſtance, they ingage <hi>Sweden</hi> to invade the <hi>Empire,</hi> and give the <hi>Emperor</hi> worke at home, allowing A.

This being the true State of thoſe times between thoſe two Crownes, we therein thus doubly miſcarried, and erred both in our Civil and Religious Intreſt.</p>
               <p>Firſt in that we thought we could never bring <hi>Spaine</hi> low enough, nor aſſiſt <hi>France</hi> ſufficiently againſt them. In this blind zeale we went a great deale too far, though nothing the length that <hi>France</hi> deſired: For had we liſtned to their ſuggeſtions, we had to this day continued our Wars with <hi>Spaine,</hi> and ſo have done their worke for them.

That which moſt inclined him to the <hi>French,</hi> was that he judged <hi>Spaine</hi> and <hi>Auſtria</hi> the two ſtrongeſt <hi>Hornes of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt,</hi> whoſe fall was come as one of his Prophets (whom I could name) in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired him, and that <hi>France</hi> might be brought to renounce <hi>Rome;</hi> intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing withall to get ſuch places in <hi>Flanders</hi> and over againſt the coaſt of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> that he might keep the <hi>Dutch</hi> in aw, and with a few of his Ships command a toll for the paſſage in the Channel, as the <hi>Dane</hi> did in the <hi>Sound.</hi> A League thereofore is made with <hi>France,</hi> March 23. 1657 for a yeare, and renewed the next, by <hi>Lockard</hi> his Ambaſſador, who for his parts and ſaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city was ſo acceptable to <hi>Mazarine,</hi> that he had more acces to him, and buſines with him, then all the Ambaſſadors at <hi>Paris</hi> beſides. Theſe two <hi>Cromwel,</hi> and the <hi>Cardinal</hi> the ſtronglier to carry on their deſignes, take in the King of <hi>Sweden</hi> for a third into their confederacy (<hi>Chriſtina</hi> having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned that Crowne, and wandring about like a blazing Comet) and theſe three Leagued together made the <hi>Triumvirate</hi> of thoſe times.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sweden</hi> was to pluck the plumes of the <hi>Roman Eagle,</hi> when he had clipt the wings of his Neighbours, that they might not fly upon the prey he left
<pb facs="tcp:56430:57"/>behind. Wherein <hi>Oliver</hi> ſo concerned himſelf, that when the <hi>Dane</hi> had got the <hi>Dutch</hi> for his ſecond, he ſent <hi>Montague</hi> to boye up <hi>Swedens</hi> ſinking intreſt in the <hi>Sound:</hi> and they were ſo neere an engagement, that they had certainly fought, had not the <hi>Engliſh</hi> eſpied an Advice-Yacht coming towards them, which bringing them newes of the <hi>Protectors</hi> death, they hoyſt up failes, and returnd home.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>France</hi> was to pull downe <hi>Spaine</hi> by Land, with his own forces, and ſuch as the Protector could ſpare. Which <hi>Lockard</hi> the Embaſſador there com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded. Who having beene more uſed to fight in the field, then play the pioneers with their ſpades, were not ſo much eſteemed at firſt by the <hi>French:</hi> till the ſight with <hi>Don John of Auſtria's</hi> Army which came to relieve <hi>Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kirke,</hi> wherein they behaved themſelves with that gallantry, that <hi>Don John</hi> cryed out he <hi>was beat by raging wild beaſts rather then men;</hi> and that great Soldjer the <hi>Prince of Conde</hi> hath often ſaid ſince, <hi>that he never ſaw the like action, as was that day performed by the Engliſh</hi> Shortly after <hi>Dunkerke</hi> yielded, and was put into the <hi>Engliſh</hi> hands.</p>
               <p>The Protector was to bring downe <hi>Spaine</hi> by Sea, which <hi>he ſaid he would do, or he and his ſhould live on bread and water.</hi> Intending allſo to carrie on the deſigne, which <hi>Sidney, Rawleight</hi> and ſeveral of the wiſeſt men of the <hi>Indies;</hi> but as ſhe had too many irons in the fire to carry on that worke, ſo how he miſcarried in it, is ſufficiently knowne. And indeed he had broke <hi>Spaines</hi> Naval power much more then he did, allthough he did a great deale at <hi>Tenerif</hi> and elſewhere, had it not been for a ſmall accident that happend, which was this. Admirall <hi>Blake,</hi> who ſtill principled his ſeamen in thoſe Confuſions and frequent Revolutions of Government, <hi>that the Fleet ſerved no Parties nor Perſons, but the Engliſh Nation;</hi> having brought ſome of his great ſhips before <hi>Tunis,</hi> batterd down the Caſtle and compeld them to his termes; for which extraordinary ſervice he expected the reward of gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude at leaſt: In ſtead thereof, by his next Advice from <hi>England</hi> he hath a pardon ſent him, for endangering, the Fleet in ſuch an attempt without or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, &amp;c. Which ſo ſtuck on the ſtomack of that ſtout and ſturdy <hi>Stoick,</hi> that afterwards the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Fleet coming on the maine Ocean off <hi>Cadiz;</hi> He reading his Commiſſion, and finding it onely for fighting them in the <hi>Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terranean,</hi> would not fall on them, though the Commanders Sollicited him, promiſed to anſwer it for him, &amp;c. onely was willing to fight if the <hi>Spanjards</hi> begun; but though the <hi>Engliſh</hi> provoked them to it, and affron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them all they could, yet the wary <hi>Spanjard</hi> was wiſer then to ingage, and ſo ſaved themſelves; at which <hi>Oliver</hi> ſtormed not a litle, but <hi>Blake</hi> cared not much, the <hi>Admirall</hi> heereby crying quits with the Generall.</p>
               <p>Thus you ſee what great things a little blind zeale may doe. And indeed it is not ſo much to be admired at in him, he having had ſuch an <hi>enthuſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call heat,</hi> as all know, that knew him well; nor can we wonder ſo much, if his head ſometimes run round, who was ſo continually wrapt up in
<pb facs="tcp:56430:58"/>ſuch whirlepooles of affaires, as he was perpetually plunged in: though to miſcarry in ſo great a concernment for the Proteſtant Intreſt, was a capitall crime in him above all others; who deſigning to pul down the <hi>Pope,</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Grotius de jure bel. &amp; pac. l. <hi>2.</hi> c. <hi>22.</hi> vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntatem implondi vaticinia, ſine Dei, mandato, non eſſè cauſam bellit</note> by bringing downe <hi>Spaine,</hi> ſet up <hi>France</hi> to ruine the <hi>Protestants</hi> throughout Chriſtendome. Thus <hi>Ludit in humanis divina potentia rebus!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But theſe three lived not long to goe on with theſe deſignes, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it was well for the world they did not. <hi>Oliver</hi> went firſt, at which <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarine,</hi> was ſecretly glad, ſaying when the newes was brought him as he was at play, <hi>there's then a fortunate foole gon.</hi> But this was but to trample upon a dead lion, whom he ſo ridiculouſly feared before, that his greateſt Confidents made themſelves privately merry therewith. Knowing how uncivily for this, he put the King of <hi>England</hi> out of <hi>France;</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Yorke</hi> allſo notwithſtanding his ſervice, and the Cavalries acclamations of <hi>vive's</hi> to him, and curſes of the <hi>Cardinal:</hi> Yea how after his death he fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red his ſhaddow, for in the <hi>Iſle of Feſant</hi> 59 at the interview of the two Kings and their Courts, where the marriage was made, and peace conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded betwixt them, (which <hi>Mazarine</hi> had reſerved for his owne glory) and the King of great <hi>Britaine</hi> being there received by <hi>Lewis de Haro</hi> at firſt with the height of a <hi>Spaniſh</hi> complement in the depth of the mire, and treated after with all civility: yet the <hi>Cardinal,</hi> though courted by the <hi>Duke of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond,</hi> durſt not ſpeake with him, for feare of <hi>Lockard</hi> that was preſent at the Treatie. But though the crafty Cardinal was no coward, yet thus feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and timorouſly was he cautious for Him, whom I know he hated above all Mortals, and that Common-wealth above all people in the world; as I can many wayes make apparent, if it was of any importance to the publick.</p>
               <p>But to be briefe, <hi>Olivers</hi> other two <hi>Conſorts</hi> followed after him quickly, and theſe three Conquerors, being cut of by death, who kept all Chriſtendome in aw whilſt they lived, the world had a little quiet, till <hi>France</hi> got a horſeback again in <hi>Flanders.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But betwixt and that time was that great change in <hi>England</hi> by the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull providence of God in the reſtoration of his Majeſty, by which meanes the <hi>French</hi> got <hi>Dunkirke</hi> again into their hands, and were therby ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacitated, the better to carry on their worke againſt theſe Countries. Atwhich the <hi>French</hi> made themſelves merry, and ſome ſay abuſively, by having <hi>Dunkirke</hi> drawn with a purſe hanging over it: The <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſtormed, and ſome ſwore <hi>Oliver would have ſold his great noſe, rather then Dunkerke.</hi> Yea this ſtill ſticks on many of their ſtomachs; I remember at my laſt being in <hi>England</hi> in 66, and ſeeing <hi>Clarenden Houſe;</hi> and wondring a little why it was ſituated ſo neer the roade, which made it both unfree, and moleſted with duſt; and critiſing upon ſome other things, the Oratory eſpecially, that the Chancelor that was the eldeſt Son of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> ſhould make his Chappel, as a wag writ of <hi>Emanuel Colledge's,</hi> ſo <hi>awry: Juſt North and South, yea verily:</hi> when I came above on the leads I was ſo pleaſed with
<pb facs="tcp:56430:58"/>the pleaſantnes of the proſpect, that I thought for that it might compare with any Houſe I had ſeen, knowing no place in <hi>England</hi> except above <hi>Greenwich,</hi> that I thought comparable to it, upon which the domeſtick had the confidence, perceiving me a ſtranger, to tell me I could not thence ſee <hi>Dunkirke;</hi> for the Commonality had Chriſtened it, and made <hi>Dunkirke</hi> the Godfather, calling the Houſe after its name. But though I confeſs it was againſt the Common Intreſt of <hi>Europe,</hi> that it ſhould fall to the <hi>French</hi> againe; yet whether it was againſt the Intreſt of the King of <hi>England,</hi> and that Kingdome, is not ſo cleare to me. I will onely ſay this, that I know a perſon hath weighed that ſo well, that I ſhall carry this chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge for him, That if any Gentleman, <hi>Engliſh</hi> or <hi>French,</hi> pleaſes fairely to ſtate this Queſtion <hi>in hypotheſi,</hi> according to the circumſtances of thoſe times, let him take which ſide thereof he pleaſes, and uſe what weapons he will (and I think thats very faire) and he ſhall not want an <hi>Antagoniſt,</hi> that ſhall fight him fairely, whether he pleaſes to appeare in <hi>Roman buf,</hi> or in his halfe ſhirt made of his owne mothers language, upon the publick Thea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the World. And truly his deſigne is ſo honeſt, I dare be his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purgator, and being a litle acquainted with it, I ſhall tell you briefly: It is to let men ſee, how hard it is ſometimes to diſcerne on which ſide the true intreſt of State lies, (there being ſo many circumſtances conſiderable, which often in the Scale of Policy, weigh heavier then that which by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanders think the maine) and therby allſo to check the ſawcines of every ſhopkeeper, who like the litle <hi>Spaniſh Dons,</hi> will be cenſuring Princes Counſels, and condemning Miniſters of State, though they are ignorant of the grounds of their Actions, and much more of that which is true policy.</p>
               <p>Having thus ſhewne the true State of <hi>France,</hi> and its continuall growing greatnes downe to the times of his preſent Majeſty, who hath not onely got <hi>Dunkirke,</hi> regained <hi>Lorraigne,</hi> conquered a great part of <hi>Flanders</hi> from the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> but three Provinces allſo entirely from the States: It will clearely fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low to be the Common Intreſt of <hi>Europe</hi> to oppoſe <hi>France</hi> in their future pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, except they meane to follow our fate.</p>
               <p>I had thought to have been larger heerein then I ſhall, in regard my paines is heerein in part prevented, by the Authour of la <hi>France Politique</hi> from page 470 to 525, or the end: And having been ſo long allready, I may happily hereafter, diſcourſe this more largely in another language. I ſhall therefore be brieſ in that which remaines.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Empire,</hi> though greatly concerned, (the <hi>French</hi> being not onely nigh them, but among them, and having got ſuch places of the <hi>Rhyne,</hi> capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citated to pas over all at their pleaſure) yet ſeeme a ſleepe, and are therefore to be rouſed; and if no words will doe it, yet let the alarmes of War raiſe them, and the ſtrength of their enimies make them combine, leſt fighting ſingly, they be all foiled. I ſhall not ſtand to particularize, but ſurely the <hi>Duke of Newburgh</hi> and <hi>Prince of Liege</hi> that have been moſt guilty in let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb facs="tcp:56430:59"/>the <hi>French</hi> have paſſage through, and quarter in their Countries; will have the firſt cauſe to repent, except they meane to ſell them to the Crowne of <hi>France;</hi> which yet may happily beat them downe in price, now they are ſo impoveriſhed by them. For though <hi>Gulick</hi> belonging to <hi>Newburg</hi> be ſtrong, the Caſtle eſpecially (which was the Patterne to that of <hi>Antwerp</hi>) yet it is on dry ground, eaſily approachable, and in a champaigne Country and not relievable from a ſiege. And if that ſmall City once be taken, all that pleaſant corne Country may cry out,
<q>
                     <l>Impius haec tam culta novalia miles habebit,</l>
                     <l>Barbarus has ſegetes!</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>And though <hi>Liege</hi> (or <hi>Luyke</hi>) be great and populous, and the deſperateſt people in all times, that I know in <hi>Europe;</hi> yet <hi>vana eſt ſine viribus ira,</hi> the City hath ſuch hills overhanging it, that it is neither ſtrong by its ſituation, nor can hope of relief if they ſhould be diſtreſſed, except it be by a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federacy from others; and if this ſingle City be loſt, all their Country will be ſo quickly.</p>
               <p>Yea not onely thoſe on this ſide the <hi>Rhijne,</hi> but even all the reſt will quickly find, that if the wings of the <hi>Roman Eagle</hi> be clipt, and prove too ſhort to ſhaddow her young Ones; they will ſoone become a prey to the power of <hi>France,</hi> and will be throwne out of their neſts as ſpurious, if they cannot ſtedfaſtly behold the riſing ſun, and will not receive their warmth from his beames.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Spaine</hi> is ſenſible enough of their concernments, knowing that not onely their <hi>Netherlands,</hi> but their <hi>Indies</hi> and <hi>Italy</hi> lie at the ſtake: for if <hi>France</hi> be Maſter of all theſe <hi>Provinces,</hi> they will ſoone be ſo of the <hi>Indies</hi> allſo; and the <hi>Dutch</hi> fetch thence, the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Gold for the <hi>French Crowne;</hi> and the <hi>Lilies of France,</hi> be the Royall flower, in all their Gardens both in <hi>Italia</hi> and <hi>Sicilia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>England,</hi> though now their Confederate, cannot but know what danger they are in for their Trade; which is the beſt jewel in that Crowne, and the greateſt darling of that Kingdome. And therefore it is high time ſurely, that the Soveraigne ſtraiten not his intereſt at home, by eſpouſing any particular party; nor the ſubjects quarrel about Ceremonies, when the ſubſtance of Religion is ſo endangered; that ſo they may timouſly looke abroad, before it be too late and all be loſt; and his Majeſty in due time retire from <hi>France,</hi> and make himſelf and ſucceſſors (as is much deſired) the Head of all the Proteſtant party in <hi>Europe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Denmark</hi> ſurely knows, that if the <hi>Empire</hi> fall they cannot ſtand: but muſt loſe both their toll in the <hi>Sound,</hi> and what by Land the <hi>French</hi> pleaſes.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Republick</hi> of all others is moſt immediately concerned, for he is blind that ſees not, whatever ſome may flatter themſelves, that the <hi>French</hi> intend nothing les then reducing of us to their obedience.</p>
               <p>And when this is done, and they advance upwards in the Empire; what are <hi>Stratsburg, Colen, Aken, Breme, Hamburg,</hi> and the reſt of the <hi>Hanſe
<pb facs="tcp:56430:59"/>Townes,</hi> and free Cities, but as ſo many morſels, eaſily eaten up and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured?</p>
               <p>Yea their conſtant friends and Allies may looke to themſelves.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sweden</hi> how they will ſave their <hi>Biſhoprick of Breme, Pomeren,</hi> and what lies on this ſide the <hi>Baltick:</hi> and how they will ſell their Copper, which is the Staple commodity of their owne Countrey. And in ſtead of the <hi>French</hi> Crownes, which is now their uſuall money amongſt them; when that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome hath no more neede of their ſervice; they may carry their owne Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per coyne on their backs to pay a collation, or laden a horſe when they travel, to pay for 2 or 3 good nights lodging.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Savoy</hi> knows he is at <hi>France</hi>'s mercy, and therefore dances after their pipe, endeavouring to ſave himſelfe by his devotion. But they may remember the Lamb in the Fable, who when the Wolf above quarreld him, becauſe he troubled the water; anſwered that could not be ſo, in regard it deſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to him, not from him; the Wolf then ſaid, he had reviled him 6 months before, to which the Lamb replying, he was not then borne. But thy Father then did ſaith He, and that's cauſe enough for the ſons ſuffering.</p>
               <p>For <hi>Switzerland,</hi> though their mountaines and Poverty may ſecure per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps their Countrey: yet what ſhall ſecure their liberty, which conſiſts in an equality amongſt them? or what ſhall ſecure the. Religion of the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Cantons?</hi> or the good pay which the <hi>Popiſh</hi> have long had, for their ſervice in the Wars of <hi>France?</hi> They muſt then be content with what they can get, or be turned to graze on their owne mountaines.</p>
               <p>And thus you ſee what neceſſity there is that the <hi>French</hi> be kept within bounds: and conſequently. that the ballance of <hi>Europe,</hi> be both brought and held in a greater equality. For intreſts changing continually with the revolution of times; and Kingdoms and Commonwealths, Cities and pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, having their youth ſtrength and old age, as well as particular perſons: If leſſer Powers combine not together, they ſingly become like the ſmaller fiſhes, eaſily ſwallowed up and devoured by the greater. Thus the league between the King of <hi>Naples,</hi>

                  </note> ſaies plainely that the contrary opinion is not to be received, and many other moderne Authors concur heerein, beſides the many Precedents of States that have made preventive Wars, as the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> againſt the
<pb facs="tcp:56430:60"/>
                  <hi>Arhenians</hi> of old, and many eſpecially of later times; and the Arguments for it are not contemptible: yet notwithſtanding I am rather of <hi>Grotius</hi>'s opinion,<note place="margin">De jure belli &amp; pac. l. <hi>2.</hi> c. <hi>1.</hi> §. <hi>17.</hi> &amp;c. <hi>22.</hi> §. 5.</note> that neither our owne feares and jealouſies, nor the growing greatnes of others, are ſufficient cauſes of warring againſt them.</p>
               <p>But indeed neither of theſe is the cauſe we plead, but the following, which we will maintaine <hi>jure gentium</hi> or by the law of Nations to be juſt and equitable.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Let any Kingdome or Common-wealth grow as great, as they can by Gods bleſſing; yet ſo long as they keep themſelves, within the bounds of juſtice and equity with others; there is no juſt cauſe of breaking downe their power by War. For jealouſie that we may thereby ſuffer, is no ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient ground for us to fight them. It being with publick as wel as private ſafety, as Phyſitians ſay it is with our health, tollerably well, but never abſolute and perfect. And therefore againſt ſuch force as we may feare, we muſt truſt the Providence of God, and uſe lawfull meanes cautiouſly to prevent dangers; our Saviour having taught all Chriſtians to uſe <hi>the wiſdome of the Serpent with the innocencie of the dove,</hi> and curſed be they that ſeperates, what Chriſt hath joyned together.</p>
               <p n="2">2. When Neighbor Nations ſee the growing power of any, whence they have juſt cauſe of jealouſie: they ought to combine together; that ſo they may prevent the dangers they feare. And if any of the Confederates be unjuſtly invaded, they have all a juſt cauſe of War againſt the Agreſſor. As the <hi>Italians</hi> being jealous of the <hi>Venetians</hi> Power,<note place="margin">Guicciar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dine's Hiſt. of Ital. l. <hi>1.</hi>
                  </note> leagued themſelves for their owne defence, ſo that though the Republick of Venice was too ſtrong for any of them ſingly, yet being far too weake for them all, was kept with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in bounds, and they thereby wiſely ſecured themſelves.</p>
               <p n="3">3. When any Potentate that is ſtronger then his Neighbors aggreſſes any of them, the reſt ought to Confederate; and if his cauſe be juſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell him to accept of due ſatisfaction, and if he will not, his cauſe then becoming unjuſt, and much more if it was ſo originally, to make War againſt him. As the <hi>Italians</hi> did againſt the <hi>French,</hi> when they under <hi>Charles</hi> the 8 were invaded. And the <hi>Triple Alliance</hi> of late, when the ſame nation had taken the <hi>County of Burgundie,</hi> commonly called the <hi>French Comté</hi> and invaded <hi>Flanders,</hi> both which belong to the Crowne of <hi>Spaine.</hi> Thus our <hi>Neighbors</hi> allſo ſhould now allie with us, in point of honeſt intreſt; that ſo we may reduce <hi>France</hi> to keepe within bounds, leſt we ſhould all be ruind by them.</p>
               <p>I ſhall make theſe things plaine by familiar example. The ballancing of Nations is like to that of boats: they that by an even <hi>poize,</hi> might all ſit ſafe in a boate on a rough Sea, by the riſing up of ſome are all in danger to be drowned. In ſuch caſe therefore the company perceiving, a quarrel likely to ariſe amongſt ſome of them, muſt either agree before hand to keepe them quiet; or if the conteſt come ſuddenly, afterwards reſolve to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, to compel thoſe that are injurious, to keepe their place; and if
<pb facs="tcp:56430:60"/>they will not, throw them over-board. And this ballancing of powers, I ſhall defend by the Fundamentall Law of Nature <hi>ſelfe-preſervation,</hi> and from the Law of Nations, as well as from the Word of God, and back the ſame by many approved examples; if any one hath a mind to conteſt with me heerein.</p>
               <p>Lets ſee a litle <hi>how,</hi> and <hi>by whom,</hi> ſtronger powers muſt be ballanced, and I ſhall give a releaſe to your patience.</p>
               <p n="1">1. By the Confederacy of weaker Nations that are their Neighbors, and are in danger thereby of being overcome, as we have allready ſhewne.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Or by a Neutrall Nation that reſerve themſelves free, to league with the weaker, when they ſee them injured by the ſtronger powers. And this was the Ancient policy of <hi>England,</hi>

                  <hi>Sect. 13.</hi> The Concluſion of the whole Diſcourſe.</head>
               <p>I Have now done, and it is high time, having been much larger then I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended at firſt; allthough not ſo large by far, as I found, being once entred upon the Argument, I might be. And yet, I hope, it will not be tedious to the Reader. Inregard of the novelty of the matter, which though daily diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſt of by many yet never writ of by any. And in regard of the uſefulnes thereof. For though old men are apt to dote upon the brats of their brain, as well as their body: Yet, if I be not deceived, this Diſcourſe, may through Gods bleſſing, prove inſtrumentall in begetting a better underſtanding between both Nations, (for which end I have publiſhed it in both Languages) by ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them their concernments, it being the <hi>Chariot of Intreſt</hi> which all Princes and States <hi>Jehu-like</hi> furiouſly drive; and allſo ſerve to cleare up ſome State Controverſies, that are not eaſily diſcerned by vulgar eyes, to diſcover the former and preſent ſtate of affaires amongſt us, and moſt parts of <hi>Europe,</hi> and give a proſpect through this intricate, darke, and cloudy War, with what hopes we may have concerning its iſſue: And beſides theſe things, I thinke the clearnes of ſtile, which I have uſed to deliver my minde in, may make it bes nautious to ſome, who are apt to mind the ſwadling cloths more then the Child.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:56430:61"/>
               <p>I know medation betwixt men in paſſion is a very thankles office; and that the freedome I have uſed, will both pleaſe and diſpleaſe many ſorts of men on all ſides; but yet when mens paſſions are allayed, I doe not doubt but they will thinke better of the honeſt deſignes of the Author. And yet I have endeavoured to give as little offence as I could poſſibly to any; but if any notwithſtanding count me their enimie, becauſe I tell them the truth, I cannot helpe it: for I never accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them worthy to write, that are by aſt with feare, or favour and flattery. Yea, I perſwade my ſelfe, that there is not any ingenuous man, or brave Gentleman even of the <hi>French</hi> Nation, whoſe deſignes I cheifly oppoſe; but they will acknowledge it lawfull for an enimie, to fight them with a pen as well as a pike, and that I am a very civil Adverſary, having both fairely fought them, and with their owne wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons, having made uſe of their Authors, and not ours, throughout my diſcourſe.</p>
               <p>I ſhall not now throw downe the gantlet and make a challenge, yet if any under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take to refute me concerning the intreſt of theſe Countries, which I thinke wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy anſwering, I ſhall not faile to doe it. As for my <hi>Conjectures,</hi> I both account and call them <hi>probable,</hi> and therfore being not poſitive and dogmaticall in them, I leave them with their Reaſons to the Reader to judge. But if ſome paſſionate perſon thinks with railing at the <hi>French, Engliſh,</hi> or the Author hereof, and carping at ſome particulars to refute me; I ſhall tell them before hand I was never bred, to give any one ill language, and ſhall onely anſwer them with ſilence and contempt. Or if any well meaning ſcholler that hath read perhaps honeſt <hi>Keckermans,</hi> or ſome others learned <hi>Syſtema Politicum;</hi> I ſhall onely ſmile in my ſleeve, having all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes accounted Booke policy alone, mere pedantry; and allthough no man va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lew's learning more then my ſelfe, yet he muſt know men as well as bookes, and the world well, that will write of theſe things. Yet if any will bring Reaſons of State, and clearely delivered, as I thinke I have done, and fairely ventilate my opinion, I ſhall promiſe him as faire an Anſwer, for <hi>truth never feared a faire tryall.</hi>

                  <p>It is neceſſary that I tell you, this worke bath been long in the birth. I had drawne up my thoughts on this ſubject the laſt yeare, and ſent my Papers into <hi>Holland</hi> to print; but my honeſt friends unacquainted with the Artifice of Governement, <hi>to nouriſh hopes in the greateſt dangers</hi> (Hope being the miſerable mans God, as well as the preſumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous mans Devil) ſent me word, of nothing but peace, yet kept my Papers through curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſity, till I was forced to ſend my ſervant for them. And baring got them, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted with a Printer here, He was called out for a Soldjer, and goe he muſt, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the worke muſt ſtand. In the meane time two ſorts of Papers came to mine hands, <hi>The Appeale;</hi> which, though his deſigne, in reference to <hi>England,</hi> be different from mine, yet in reference to <hi>France,</hi> being much the ſame, I let pas for the preſent; and the <hi>Chancelor of Englands</hi> ſpeech, with his <hi>Defenda eſt Carthago,</hi> which whilſt my Printer after his returne home is printing off this, I examined, according to the Rules of <hi>Chriſtian Charity, Common Equity,</hi> and <hi>State Policy;</hi> but that being too large, I reſerve it for an <hi>Appendix.</hi> In the meane time, though it be late before this comes forth (the Moneth of April <hi>73.</hi>) yet I hope better late then never; and though no Printer well undertake it, becauſe it is Paradoxical to the common opinion of Peace, yet I have put it into the publick Treaſury for good, at my owne charge in both Languages; and though it coſt me <hi>100 <abbr>l</abbr>
                     </hi> and none conſider me, or to uſe <hi>Solomons</hi> phraſe, <hi>Remember that poore man,</hi> in any kind, not ſo much as to enquire after him, or returne him thanks; yet it ſhall not repent me for the good of both Nations, for which I intend it, and to whom I wiſh a happy peace, and all proſperity.</p>
