         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Lthough in ≈øo ≈ømall a Tractate, it may be thought needle≈øs to give an account of the occa≈øion thereof; yet I think my ≈øelf obliged for your further ≈øatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, to do it briefly. The Author having been lately in <hi>Holland,</hi> found what the <hi>Zeelanders</hi> had done in the late Revolutions, mi≈øunder≈øtood by ≈øome, and variou≈øly cen≈øured by others; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thought it worth his pains, fairly and mode≈øtly to vindicate the ≈øame. And the rather, becau≈øe he fore≈øees various pretexts will be deduced thence, and divers interpretations be made thereof, which the Author hopes by his declaring the true intent and meaning, to free it from. That ≈øo all tho≈øe, who≈øe Curio≈øity or Intere≈øt leads them to inquire, might be acquainted with the true Grounds and Rea≈øons thereof; and that neither the propen≈øity of ≈øome to the <hi>French,</hi> nor the prejudice and pa≈ø≈øion of others again≈øt the <hi>Engli≈øh,</hi> might make us run blindfold upon our ruine; but that we may di≈øcern our true <hi>Intere≈øt,</hi> and pur≈øue it as occa≈øion ≈øhall require. For as all affection to that which is not our real Intere≈øt, ≈øo all aver≈øation from that which is, is madne≈øs and folly; which clouds Rea≈øon, precipitates Coun≈øels, runs us upon extreams, and drives us into inevitable de≈øtruction, many times before we are aware.</p>
            <p>I know ≈øome will be apt to ≈øay, What need of this now? The Storm is over, and the ≈øuppo≈øition of inability to defend our felves out of doors. If I thought ≈øo, I a≈ø≈øure you I ≈øhould neither trouble my ≈øelf, nor others any further. But whether it be my love to the Countrey, and de≈øire of the welfare thereof; or my jealou≈øie over the Factions of the Rulers, and tumultuou≈øne≈øs of the people therein; or my comparing and e≈øtimating our own ≈øtrength, fidelity, and courage with our Enemies; or my ob≈øerving, that our former Military Di≈øcipline (which made us renowned, and our Countrey accounted the School of War) is in a great mea≈øure, if not ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly decayed and lo≈øt; or my hearing how old Officers, and Forein Forces have been ≈ølighted; and ≈øuch preferred, as are unexperienced for conduct, and untried for courage; or the difference I have ob≈øerved in the valour of a poor and rich people; Poverty always ≈øtirring up and whetting Valour, out of hopes to better their condition; whereas riches makes men fearful of lo≈øing what they have, and ≈øo falling into a wor≈øe. As may be ob≈øerved not onely in different people, as between the Northern and Southern Nations, but al≈øo in the ≈øame, yea in our ≈øelves. For when poor in our Wars with <hi>Spain,</hi>

<pb facs="tcp:56430:4"/>all the <hi>German</hi> Nations, or People, the <hi>Batavians,</hi> were cheif for valour; but now that we are grown rich, we are affraid to adventure either our Per≈øons or E≈øtates, and readier to open our Gates, then ≈øhut them again≈øt our Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. Or, whether it be my Melancholly temper only; or my fears and cowardi≈øe, if you plea≈øe to call it ≈øo; or my fancy from my ob≈øervation, that the third War (as this is with <hi>England</hi>) hath ever proved fatal to the one ≈øide, as is apparent by many examples; or what ever other cau≈øe it is, I mu≈øt profe≈øs freely, that I am of another ≈øentiment, this War having ≈øo black a vi≈øage to mine appearance, that I fear we are rather in the mid≈øt of a Tempe≈øtuous Sea of Troubles, then di≈øcovering of Land, much le≈øs a ≈øafe Harbour of re≈øt.</p>
            <p>I am not ignorant upon how many pins men hang their hopes. Some upon the advancement of his Highne≈øs the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> hope all will be redre≈øt and well at home; and that his relation to the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> and the Elector of <hi>Brandenburgh,</hi> will capacitate him to remedy all abroad. Others upon conjectures of his marrying with the Duke of <hi>Yorks</hi> Daughter, or ≈øome nearly related to the Crown of <hi>England</hi> or <hi>France;</hi> which hath been an u≈øual way I confe≈øs, e≈øpecially among ab≈øolute Princes, of accomoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting differences. Some upon our ≈øufficient numbers of Men and Moneys to defend our ≈øelves. Other≈øome upon the A≈ø≈øi≈øtance of the <hi>Emperor,</hi> and the <hi>German</hi> Princes, <hi>Brandenburgh</hi> e≈øpecially. And others upon their opinion, that now the Pen≈øionary <hi>de Wit</hi> and his party are broken, ≈øo that <hi>England</hi> can confide more in our friend≈øhip, that the King will break with <hi>France,</hi> and afford his Nephew and the≈øe <hi>Netherlands</hi> a≈ø≈øi≈øtance; e≈øpecially becau≈øe they judge, that it is the Intere≈øt of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Germany,</hi> as well as <hi>Spain,</hi> not to ≈øee us fall into the <hi>French</hi> hands, for fear they have only <hi>Polyphemus</hi> his courte≈øie, to be la≈øt devoured. But yet all the≈øe grouds, and divers others, which are variou≈øly di≈øcour≈øed of, prevail not ≈øo far with me, as that my hopes can ballance my fears.</p>
            <p>For although I grant the ≈øtrength of the remaining Provinces to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øiderable both by Sea and Land; and the greate≈øt foundation to build our hopes upon, next under God Almighties Protection; yet if we duly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øider the ≈øtate and condition we are in, there is not that ju≈øt ground of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence, which may free us from fears; as many are apt to imagine.

For the pompe of Government ≈øo da≈øles the eyes of tho≈øe that know not the Weight of it, that when there is any ≈øeeming acce≈øs thereto, all are apt to contend for it, and every one to thinke him≈øelf as capable as his neighbor, and vy with one another with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out end: till they that were formerly good pa≈ø≈øengers, now turning Pilots in a Storm; through their continuall contentions and unskilfulne≈øs, ≈øhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrack the Common-wealth, whil≈øt they ≈øincerely de≈øire and endeavour to ≈øave it. I ≈øhall therefore conclude, that although we have a good <hi>Head,</hi> yet except the members be at unity, and unanimou≈øly re≈øolved to give a≈ø≈øi≈øtance to their Head and Governours; it is in vaine to thinke, we can be ≈øecured from ≈øuch potent enemies, (except any be ≈øo mad as to expect miracles) or that the Princes name or waying of his Flag upon our Towers can defend us.</p>
            <p>For his marrying his Highne≈øs the <hi>Duke of Yorks</hi> Daughter, we may ≈øpeak of it here, and tho≈øe in <hi>England</hi> of the King of <hi>Sweden,</hi> and both be mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtaken.

            <p>For our a≈ø≈øi≈øtance from the <hi>Emperor</hi> and <hi>Germain Princes,</hi> which is ≈øo much talkt of, the <hi>Brandenburgs</hi> e≈øpecially; if I were a≈ø≈øured they de≈øigned to ≈øerve us, and not them≈øelves of us; I ≈øhould have more hopes then I have. I know the <hi>Germains</hi> are a great and warlike Nation, and that none almo≈øt have warred with them, that have not repented it. And when we ≈øee them warr with <hi>France,</hi> though they directly a≈ø≈øi≈øt us not further, ≈øuch a diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion to our enemie will be a con≈øiderable advantage to us.

The <hi>Emperor</hi> is not onely continually kept waking by the <hi>Turk;</hi> but at pre≈øent diverted al≈øo by the di≈øtractions of <hi>Hungary.</hi> And the fears of <hi>Poland,</hi> will nece≈ø≈øitate <hi>Brandenburg</hi> to have an eye to <hi>Pru≈ø≈øia.</hi> The Princes of the Empire are many, and divided, (≈øeveral of them declaring for <hi>France,</hi> others wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering and waiting opportunity to clo≈øe with the prevailing ≈øide) which makes their Coun≈øels ≈ølow, and more ≈øubject to be di≈øcovered, the rai≈øing men and bringing them together more difficult, the commanding of them more lyable to di≈øcord (which hath often proved fatal in their Armies) and the providing for them very uncertaine. And I might ad hereunto (for it is well knowne) that ≈øome of the <hi>Germain</hi> Princes have ≈øo run out their revenues; that though they have men far more then their proportion, yet have not money to pay the half of their rate.

We may think, and the <hi>Engli≈øh</hi> Nation may be jealous (as I know they are) that <hi>France</hi> will couzen them at la≈øt, and ≈øerve them now as <hi>Comines</hi> tells us they have formerly,<note place="margin">l. <hi>3.</hi> c. <hi>8.</hi> &amp; l. <hi>4.</hi> c. <hi>9.</hi> Bodin de Rep. l. <hi>5.</hi> c. <hi>1.</hi>

            <p>Should I ≈øpeak my private apprehen≈øion, 'tis briefly this, <hi>England</hi> hath been long jealous of the growing greatne≈øs of this State by Sea, and find it an error of Policy in former Governors, to ≈øuffer us to arrive at this height of conte≈øting with them. From whence they have met with ≈øeveral inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences in regard of Trade, and al≈øo been put to va≈øt expences to maintain con≈øtantly a Fleet to cope with us. The≈øe things they would willingly ea≈øe them≈øelves of, which they know cannot be done, but by the Sword. The fir≈øt War which was occa≈øionally begun, was no time to effect their de≈øigns, in regard the Kingdom was harra≈øt and exhau≈øted by a long Civil War, and <hi>Oliver</hi> the Protectors cheif de≈øign was to ≈øettle him≈øelf, and therefore made Peace. The ≈øecond War advantaged them nothing; for the <hi>French</hi> countenancing us (though ≈øecretly in League with them before the War was ended) they were not able to effect what they de≈øigned, having lo≈øt their opportunity which they had after the fir≈øt battel in their hands: That being often verified of the <hi>Engli≈øh,</hi> which was ≈øaid of <hi>Hannibal,</hi> (by whom matters not, for the Learned Hi≈øtorians <hi>Livie</hi> and <hi>Plutarch</hi> differ therein,) <hi>Vincere ≈øcis Hannibal; victoria uti ne≈øcis.</hi> A Peace is concluded at <hi>Breda,</hi> but the War had a ≈øting in the tale of it, the work at <hi>Chattam, Ma<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               <pb facs="tcp:56430:6"/>for the future.

               </note> what ever the pretext be, (for <hi>Polybius</hi> hath long ≈øince taught us to di≈øtingui≈øh the≈øe two by ≈øundry Examples) yet I am far from a≈ø≈øerting it alone a ju≈øtifieable cau≈øe of any War.

            <list>
               <item>1. That in their League with <hi>France</hi> they have made provi≈øion for the≈øe; ≈øo that if the <hi>French</hi> prevail, they ≈øhall have ≈øuch Maritime places, as may be a real ≈øecurity to them in the≈øe particulars.</item>
               <item>2. That they will never ≈øuffer <hi>France</hi> (if they can po≈ø≈øibly hinder it) to have all the≈øe Maritime Provinces entirely. For if our might alone be ≈øuch an eye-≈øore to them, how much more if it ≈øhould be joyned with that of <hi>France.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>3. That they will not de≈øi≈øt, till they have tried their utmo≈øt, to obtain the≈øe ends which they account their Intere≈øt; having now the advantage of Alliance with <hi>France,</hi> their joynt Power and Prevalency, and our pre≈øent Weakne≈øs and Di≈øtractions. So that I cannot flatter my ≈øelf ≈øo much as to hope, That either the Princes Relation to His Maje≈øty can procure, or Money purcha≈øe our Peace with them, ≈øo long as they ≈øee any probability of effecting their de≈øigns.</item>

               <p>HE is a Stranger to us and our Affairs, who knows not; that the late Revolutions among us, and particularly at <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>trechts</hi> betaking them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves to the <hi>French</hi> for protection, were attended both with great con≈øternation, and various deliberations, as is u≈øual in ≈øuch di≈øa≈øters. When therefore mi≈øery and de≈øtruction was approaching as a violent torrent, that bears down all before it; Self-pre≈øervation being the Fundamental Law of Nature; every Province, City, and almo≈øt Village, began to con≈øider, what they ≈øhould do to pre≈øerve them≈øelves, from being drowned in the overflow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deluge.</p>
               <p>Some were of opinion, that the remaining Provinces were of ≈øufficient ≈øtrength to defend them≈øelves, and therefore lookt no further. Others were of a contrary judgment; and therefore thought it better, upon rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øonable terms, to put our ≈øelves under a Forein Power, as <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>trecht</hi> had done, then to be conquered by the Sword. And herein al≈øo mens judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments were divided, ≈øome thinking it better to be under the <hi>French,</hi> others to be under the <hi>Engli≈øh.</hi> Tho≈øe of <hi>Holland</hi> (as was commonly reported) were more inclinable to the former, in regard of their near approach to them in <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>trecht;</hi> and e≈øpecially out of an opinion which many have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained, That the Intere≈øt of <hi>Holland,</hi> being principally that of Trade by Sea, was more competible with that of <hi>France</hi> then <hi>England,</hi> In≈øomuch, that many believe, if the advice of Mon≈øieur <hi>Pompone</hi> of the Kings ≈øending <hi>Charte Blanche</hi> had been followed; the Cities of <hi>Holland</hi> had at that time ≈øeveral of them imitated the example of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>trecht;</hi> tho≈øe of <hi>Zealand</hi> were generally inclined to the <hi>Engli≈øh.</hi> But as opinions are u≈øually both bred and brought up by Pa≈ø≈øions; ≈øo here it was manife≈øt, That the exce≈ø≈øive hopes of the former, made them for ab≈øolute defence; and the exce≈ø≈øive fears of the latter, for ab≈øolute re≈øignation. In ≈øuch ca≈øes there are two ways have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways been found ≈øafe≈øt and be≈øt for accommodation, <hi>viz.</hi> A due examination of the Grounds of tho≈øe Pa≈ø≈øions, and a ju≈øt temperament or comprehen≈øion of the diver≈øity of Opinions: Which here ≈øo happily fell out, that it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øolved upon and declared by many in <hi>Zeeland,</hi> fir≈øt, <hi>That they would u≈øe their be≈øt endeavors to defend them≈øelves;</hi> and ≈øecondly, <hi>if they found them≈øelves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, they Would then re≈øign to the Engli≈øh.</hi> Hereby ≈øhewing, that they neither did through vain fears, wholly de≈øpond of their own ≈øtrength; nor through flattering hopes were wholly fearle≈øs of their Enemies. They would try and u≈øe the be≈øt means they could, to ≈øtand of them≈øelves according to their hopes; and yet al≈øo provide again≈øt the wor≈øt of their fears, which was their fall by ab≈øolute conque≈øt.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:56430:7"/>
               <p>For the manner of doing this, I ≈øhall neither accu≈øe, nor defend it; though the Magi≈øtrate led not the Van of Con≈øent, according to his place and dignity,<note place="margin">Plut. l. de fort.</note> yet he followed clo≈øe in the Rear. And though it was done ha≈øtily, yet why may not a ha≈øty Pen, ≈øometimes be as happy as <hi>Apelles</hi> his Pencil, which in Pa≈ø≈øion being thrown on the Picture, better portrayed the Hor≈øes foaming, then all his premeditated Coun≈øel and Art.</p>
               <p>It is enough to me, and to my purpo≈øe, that what was done is agreeable to the true Intere≈øt of the Countrey; which I hope to make apparent in the following Di≈øcour≈øe. But before I do that, give me leave to premi≈øe a few things, which tend to the clearing of the Matters in que≈øtion.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. That we only ≈øuppo≈øe this inability for the pre≈øent, to ≈øatisfie the curio≈øity of the World, which never think their <hi>teli≈øcope</hi> long enough, to ≈øee to the utmo≈øt end of Intere≈øt.

The <hi>Romans</hi> ≈øaying was <hi>Pro aris &amp; focis,</hi> therein giving Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the preference of all their civil concernments. And if we Chri≈øtians do not, the more is our ≈øin, and the greater our ≈øhame.

But if examples would either ≈øway us, or ≈øhame us, I need not go ≈øo far for them, our own Ance≈øtors are abundantly ≈øufficient. I am ≈øure (if the Hi≈øtory of former times deceive me not) Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion was the cheif inducement to them, to begin that hazardous War with <hi>Spain.</hi> And had ≈øuch an impre≈ø≈øion upon them, that they freely ventured their lives and e≈øtates for this e≈øpecially; although I know there were many other grievances in≈øi≈øted on, to ju≈øtifie that War.

               <p n="6">6. Let the be≈øt he ≈øuppo≈øed that any rationall man can imagine, yet will it be bad enough.

And this begins to appear in ≈øome places allready, where the Popi≈øh Inhabitants are more in≈øufferably in≈øulting, ≈øpightfull, and injurious than the <hi>French</hi> them≈øelves.

                  <hi>Sect. 4:</hi> Objections from the danger of lo≈øing our Religion under England; from the Kings being a Papi≈øt, de≈øigning to ≈øet up Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery; the increa≈øe, countenance, and tolleration of Papi≈øts, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øo from his joyning with France again≈øt us, and Church Governe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by Bi≈øhops, all an≈øwered.</head>
               <p>But now on the other hand it is by ≈øome objected again≈øt the <hi>Engli≈øh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. That the King is a Papi≈øt in heart, and de≈øignes to ≈øet up the Popi≈øh Religion.</p>
               <p>Fir≈øt what the King is in his heart, and what he de≈øignes, is onely knowne to God Almighty, who is the ≈øearcher of hearts. That he is a profe≈øt prote≈øtant, is well knowne. And allthough I will not ≈øweare for him nor any man alive, that he will not change his Religion; yet to me it ≈øeems very improbable, upon the following grounds.</p>
               <p n="1">1. He that would not in his minority, when under his Mothers educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in <hi>France,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">K. Charles I. Letters.</note> but followed his Fathers in≈øtructions, of <hi>being obedient to her in all things, excepting the matter of her Religion;</hi> I cannot thinke will now in his maturity.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:56430:10"/>
               <p n="2">2. His with≈øtanding ≈øo many temptations wherewith he was environed ≈øo long a time together, during tho≈øe many years of his exile; wherein neither the friend≈øhip of Papi≈øts, nor unkindne≈øs and hard mea≈øure he met withal from Prote≈øtants could move him;<note place="margin">Militi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ere's Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory of the Truth, and Bp. Bramhalls An≈øwer.</note> makes me think him much more immovable, now he is free from tho≈øe. Who that knows tho≈øe times, knows not what de≈øigns the Papi≈øts had upon him? What Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øwa≈øions and Arguments they u≈øed both by word and writing? What Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈øes they made him of a≈ø≈øi≈øtance to recover his Kingdoms? What Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments of Intere≈øt they pre≈øt him with, which are u≈øually more prevalent with Princes, than the intrin≈øick Arguments of Religion? And if he ≈øtood un≈øhaken in all tho≈øe boy≈øterous bla≈øts, ≈øhall we thinke he will fall in a calme?</p>
               <p n="3">3. His re≈øcuing his younge≈øt Brother the <hi>Duke of Gloce≈øter</hi> out of his Mothers hands, when her de≈øignes appeared for perverting him in his Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; is an evident proofe of the realty of his Profe≈ø≈øion. If any one ≈øay it was his Intere≈øt for regaining his Kingdoms. I ≈øay.</p>
               <p n="4">4. And is it not his Intere≈øt al≈øo for keeping them? Did he gaine them ≈øo quickly, or are his three Kingdoms ≈øo little worth, that he ≈øhould ea≈øily hazard them? Kings are wi≈øer then to venture their Crownes upon every idle Prie≈øts pratles. If there were any ≈øtronger Arguments now then formerly, either for the Popi≈øh Religion, or from his Intere≈øt; we had ≈øome rea≈øon to be jealous that he might change.</p>
               <p>But 5. It is apparently again≈øt his Intere≈øt, not onely in regard of the danger he might incur of lo≈øing his Crownes, but the great lo≈øs which would inevitably accrew to him by this change.</p>
               <p>The danger we cannot imagine to be ≈ømall, if we rightly con≈øider tho≈øe Kingdoms. I have had an accompt (having been a little curious in tho≈øe enquiries) of 1100000 of his Subjects, that by Intere≈øt and Inclination were carried counter to the Court. Under the≈øe five Heads.

                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>I might ad to the≈øe, that which further ≈øatisfies me, that having been at <hi>Bruxels, Colen,</hi> and mo≈øt of tho≈øe places, where his Maje≈øty during his exile did re≈øide; I can ≈øay <hi>bona fide</hi> that in all the variety of companies and conver≈øe I was ever in, I never heard any probable grounds, from any one intelligent per≈øon, that toucht, much les ≈øtain'd his Maje≈øties reputation in this particular. But I will not impo≈øe this upon others, though it moves me to ≈øay the more, becau≈øe I am not willing to annex my name to what I have written. Not that I am a≈øhamed to owne what I conceive to be the reall truth, which I have publi≈øhed in this treati≈øe to the world, and can make good much more largely: but becau≈øe I know who I am, and that my name can ad no e≈øtimation to this politicall di≈øcour≈øe; but rather per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps prejudice ≈øome who knowes me not, and are u≈øed to judge of writings by their authors; whereas tho≈øe that will impartially ≈øearch after truth, mu≈øt have regard to <hi>things,</hi> not <hi>per≈øons</hi> and to what is written, and not the writers thereof.</p>
               <p>As for his ≈øetting up popery, I neither thinke that he will, for the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going rea≈øons; nor if he would, that he can, for the≈øe following e≈øpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. The Prote≈øtant Religion is ≈øetled in all his Kingdomes by their fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall lawes, which the King cannot repeale. It is true he hath the executive power of the lawes, and ≈øo can ≈øu≈øpend the execution of penalties; but cannot re≈øcind any one law, much le≈ø≈øe make new ones, without the con≈øent of Parliament in his re≈øpective Kingdomes. And ab≈øolute Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raingty is not there in u≈øe. For power paramount to all lawes, carries too great a top-≈øaile for an <hi>Engli≈øh</hi> bottom; wherein the Subjects liberties are ≈øhipt, as well as <hi>Coe≈øar and his fortunes.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. The lands and revenues formerly ≈øupporting the Romi≈øh Religion, which are many and great, are in the po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of the nobility and gentry for the mo≈øt part; and have beene bought by them of the Crowne at the
<pb facs="tcp:56430:11"/>di≈ø≈øolution of Abbies, Mona≈øteries, &amp;c. And the purcha≈øes confirmed by law. And can we thinke that they will be ever induced to part with them againe? or enact any ≈øuch lawes as ≈øhall tend to their owne ruine, and the utter undoing of their families? If there was ≈øo much danger and difficulty to wre≈øt them out of the hands of the poore Votaries, (as the Hi≈øtories of tho≈øe times tell us) What will there be to recover them from the powerfull Nobility and Gentry? who legally po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øing them will doubtle≈øs defend them, ≈øo that none ≈øhall deprive them thereof, that have not better courage and ≈øharper Swords then they.</item>
                  <item>3. The great di≈øparity in the number of Prote≈øtants and Papi≈øts. There being not one family of a hundred in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland</hi> Popi≈øh, and in many and great Pari≈øhes not a Papi≈øt. Now what greater madne≈øs can we imagine, than that his Maje≈øty ≈øhould adventure to rely upon the Papi≈øts alone, again≈øt all the Prote≈øtants of the three Nations. Though their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers are greater then formerly, yet are they comparatively ≈ømall (as we have ≈øaid) to tho≈øe that profes the Reformed Religion. So that it can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver enter into my braine, that ≈øuch folly ≈øhould enter into any Princes bre≈øt, much les one who hath ≈øuffered ≈øo much, by the former divi≈øions of his Kingdoms.</item>
                  <item>4. The va≈øt difference between a people enlightned by the Go≈øpel, and well grounded in their Religion, and an ignorant and unprincipled people. For the generality of the common people brought up in ignorance, (as they u≈øually are under Popery) are more ≈øubject to receive impre≈ø≈øions from their Teachers, and ≈øo by degrees change their Profe≈ø≈øion. Whereas tho≈øe who are a≈ø≈øured from the Word of God, that they are in the right; will by no means be induced to the ≈øame. And u≈øually the more force is u≈øed, the more ob≈øtinate they are. For a ≈øetled Con≈øcience de≈øpi≈øes dain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and defies all the terrors and torments, that their cruelle≈øt adver≈øaries can invent. If in le≈ø≈øer differences of Church-government, the King hath found it ≈øo difficult, that after all the coercive Lawes, and other meanes he hath u≈øed, he tells the world, <hi>'tis evident by the ≈øad experience of twelve yeares, that there is very little fruit of all tho≈øe forceable cour≈øes;</hi>

Surely not much from the Pious and ≈øober party of Prote≈øtants; for I neither matter nor mention the ruder ≈øort, and ignorant rable. Nay univer≈øall experience hath taught the World, that where any kind of Religion is powerfull, all force again≈øt it is weake and contemptible: and much more again≈øt the true Reformed Religion; as that wi≈øe and excellent Hi≈øtorian <hi>Thuanus</hi> ≈øhewes in the Preface to his Hi≈øtory,<note place="margin">The other two are <hi>Calv.</hi> to his In≈øtit. &amp; <hi>Cau≈øa<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

For though it well becomes a vertuous Wife, to e≈øteem her own Husband, the be≈øt head ≈øhe can have; and accordingly to be guided by him: yet if ≈øhe will cen≈øure all other Wives, for meer ≈ølaves; all her neighbours round about her, will ring her a peale of indignation.</item>
                  <item>2. That the be≈øt way to judge of peoples liberty is by con≈øidering it in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to Soveraignty. For all ≈øubjection and government being relatives; and Subject, liberty con≈øi≈øting, in ≈øuch a manner of ≈øubjection to the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Powers, as is free and not ≈ølavi≈øh; the one is ea≈øily knowne by the other. So that if we duly con≈øider Supremacy, we may di≈øcerne, whether the Subjects be free or no by the manner, and the degrees of their freedom, by the mea≈øure of their ≈øubjection.</item>
                  <item>3. That we mu≈øt di≈øtingui≈øh between <hi>actual liberty.</hi> or freedom from op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈ø≈øion; and <hi>legal liberty</hi> by con≈øtitution. For freedom may be con≈øidered either in regard of morall power, or government which is the exerci≈øe thereof; and that both ≈øeverally, and joyntly. For a people free by Law, may be oppre≈ø≈øed by their Rulers; and a people not legally free, may be actually ≈øo by their Governors grace. So that actuall liberty alone, is onely under ab≈øolute Powers, legal under limited and mixed, and both under Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments which proceed regularly, in the Sphere of Power wherein they are placed, and are not planetary in their motions. Having premi≈øed the≈øe things; we ≈øhall now proceed to lay down certain rules, whereby every vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar capacity may judge, of the nature of liberty and the degrees thereof, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der any kind of Soveraignty what≈øoever. Whether it re≈øide in a ≈øingle per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon, or in a plurality; either ab≈øolute, or limited in regard of its mea≈øure; or for the manner ≈øimple or mixed; either of two or three e≈øtates, equally or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equally, and from whatever priority or predominant part denominated, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy, Ari≈øtocracy, or Democracy, according to the con≈øtitution of every Nation.</item>
               </list>
               <p>And the general rule is this. <hi>The greater power in the Soveraignty, the le≈ø≈øer liberty in the Subjects; and the le≈øs power in the Soveraignty, the more liberty in the Subjects.</hi> It is not my pre≈øent work to determine, whether of the≈øe is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for the whole. The Polititians pens have ≈øufficiently ventilated that que≈øtion; u≈øually a≈øcribing more ≈øtrength and ≈øtability to the former, and more common pro≈øperity to the latter; though often concluding, either through favour or fear and fl<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                  </gap>ttery, that that Government under which they live, de≈øerves above all to weare the garland I ≈øhall therefore onely ≈øay this, that ≈øeeing extreames are alwayes dangerous; a golden meane is
<pb facs="tcp:56430:14"/>that, which makes a golden age, both to Soveraigns and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects.</p>
               <p>Now although I judge this rule alone, ≈øufficient for our pre≈øent purpo≈øe; yet in regard ≈øome perhaps, may be plea≈øed with ≈øo large a pro≈øpect, as the liberty of all Nations in all ages of the world; we ≈øhall take a fuller view thereof; and the rather, becau≈øe it will be of u≈øe to us hereafter, not onely in this but the following Sections. And for this end will begin at the bottom, that ≈øo a≈øcending by degrees, we may behold both it and them the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
               <p n="1">1. A people under <hi>ab≈øolute power,</hi> are not truly and legally free, but onely permi≈ø≈øively and precariou≈øly. Becau≈øe their liberty is not from Law, but onely founded in their Governors favor. So that they are liable to all oppre≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion, although they are ≈øometimes as actually free, and little oppre≈ø≈øed, as tho≈øe that live under other Governments.</p>
               <p>And this liberty, as to the certainty thereof, is more or les according to the degrees of ab≈øolute power. Where the Rulers will, is the peoples Law; freedom is an <hi>Embryo,</hi> rather than formed: when they make Laws, whereby Subjects are at more certainty; it then becomes a <hi>foetus:</hi> and when they oblige them≈øelves, to rule by tho≈øe Laws; the <hi>child</hi> is borne, and may cry out of violence and oppre≈ø≈øion. This <hi>liberty,</hi> how ≈ømall ≈øoever, and uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of life, hath yet many witne≈ø≈øes to avouch its name; which we find al≈øo regi≈øtred in Antiquity. So that who≈øoever denies the ≈øame; mu≈øt call all tho≈øe <hi>≈ølaves,</hi> who lived under the Ea≈øtern and Roman Empires of old, and the Turks and Per≈øians at this day.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Under <hi>limited power,</hi> the people have a legall liberty, which is greater or les, according to the Laws, con≈øtitutions, or contracts, whereby the power is limited. Whether originally and antecedently; or by after conde≈øcent, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt tho≈øe in Supremacy and them in ≈øubjection; is not much materiall. This liberty being ≈øupported by Law, not voluntarily made by the Governors them≈øelves, and alterable at their plea≈øure (as in ab≈øolute power) but nece≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øarily conde≈øcended to by them that will governe, makes the ≈øubjection of a people tolerable And if the Fathers in power plea≈øe to fo≈øter them, they want not for nece≈ø≈øaries, though they abound not in ≈øuperfluities. But I confes, if this freedom meet with a churli≈øh ≈øtepfather, and hath neither guardian not friends to maintain its right; then its forced to keep private at home, and dare ≈øcarce appear in publike; which makes their pre≈øent condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion mi≈øerable. For liberty once lamed by power, is not unlike to a labouring man, that hath his leg broken; who till it be ≈øound, Is thereby confined to his own cottage, or cralls but abroad to beg with his crutches.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Tho≈øe that live under a <hi>mixed power,</hi> have more or les liberty according to the temperament thereof.</p>
               <p>If mixt of Monarchie and Acri≈øtocracy onely, the common peoples liberty is according to their Laws. And is more ≈øecured by this compo≈øition, than in a ≈øimple governement, though limited; becau≈øe one is a check to the
<pb facs="tcp:56430:15"/>exorbitancy of the other. For though every mixt power be limited, yet every limited power is not mixt. In this Government, though the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, ≈øhould as Cedars ≈øhelter the under≈øhrubs, from the ≈øtorms of the ≈øuperior order; yet both Hi≈øtorie and experience ≈øhews us, that often times (I ≈øay not allwayes) the Peeres care not to be their Princes Va≈ø≈øalls, that ≈øo the re≈øt of the people may be theirs.</p>
               <p>If mixed ≈øo that the common people have a ≈øhare in the Supreme Power, they are <hi>ab≈øolutely free;</hi> and their liberty is more or les, according as their ≈øhare is. Whether it be mixed of all the three kinds of Government, <hi>viz.</hi> Monarchie, Ari≈øtocracy, and Democracy; or onely of the two latter; for I never read or heard of a State compounded of the two extreames.</p>
               <p>Now the Supreme Power con≈øi≈øts e≈øpecially (I ≈øay not onely)
<list>
                     <item>1. In en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acting, interpreting, and repealing of Laws.</item>
                     <item>2. In electing and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing ≈øubordinate Magi≈øtrates and Mini≈øters of State for Government.</item>
                     <item>3. In judging and determining all crimes and controver≈øies among≈øt their Subjects, ultimately without appeale.</item>
                     <item>4. In leavying of taxes to defray publick expences.</item>

                     <item>6. In making War and Peace with others. So then as a people partake in the≈øe, their freedom is accordingly to be accounted of. And here liberty is come to maturity; and if ≈øhe be mode≈øt, and keep within her bounds, and fall not into wanton licentiou≈øne≈øs; ravi≈øhes the eyes of all ≈øpectators, fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling their mouthes with her prai≈øes, and their mindes with admiration.</item>

               <p>But it is high time that we ha≈øten unto the third particular propo≈øed, which is the accommodation of the≈øe, to the ≈øubject matter we have in hand.</p>
               <p>Fir≈øt then, it is well known, that there is a very va≈øt difference in the liberty of the Subjects of the≈øe two Crowns. The common people under the King of England have 1. A part in the legi≈ølative power, which is the chief au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority in all Governements. For the Commons make a third State in all the three Kingdoms; and have their repre≈øentatives freely cho≈øen by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves in all Parliaments; which are the true Con≈øervatories of publique liberty and particular propriety. Whereas the common people in France either never had this priviledge; or if they had, have long ≈øince lo≈øt it That they had it formerly,<note place="margin">Franco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gallioe. c. <hi>10.11.15.</hi> Derepubl. l. <hi>2.</hi> c. <hi>6. ¬ß. 6.</hi>

                  <hi>Hottoman</hi> endeavours to prove, which <hi>Arni≈øoeus</hi> denies, (and an≈øwers his rea≈øons,) nor that only, but all mixture in the French Monarchy either with Princes of the Blood, Peers, or any other State what≈øoever. But whatever was the Governement, under the two fir≈øt lines of the Kings of France; it is generally agreed, that in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the third under <hi>Hugh Capet,</hi> (who cantond out France about the yeare 990) the peoples liberty was devoured by the Dukes and Earles of the Provinces, and the Monarchie allmo≈øt turned into a Toparchie, by rea≈øon of their hereditary right. Which the after Kings ≈øoone perceiving, to be too great a ballance to the Crowne, broke down by degrees; and ≈øo became the only <hi>Atlas's</hi> that have ever ≈øince ≈øu≈øtan'd that Government. For the A≈ø≈øembly of the three E≈øtates, which were the only bulwark of the
<pb facs="tcp:56430:15"/>publick liberty, that was left undemoli≈øhed by de≈øpotical powers; if they ever had any ≈øhare in the legi≈ølative, lo≈øt it long before <hi>Capets</hi> time, (for from <hi>Charles</hi> the great the Kings Edicts have pa≈øt for Laws.) and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing di≈øcontinued in their Wars with <hi>England,</hi> and their remaining power (whatever it was) broke down by the policy of <hi>Lewis</hi> the eleventh; they were finally laid a≈øide by <hi>Lewis</hi> the la≈øt. And although <hi>Philip</hi> the fourth fixed that Court of Judicature at <hi>Paris,</hi> that was formerly ambulatory and u≈øually accompanied the Kings Court, which became a pattern to the re≈øt of their Provincial Parliaments; yet both that and the≈øe have only the name and ≈øhadow; not the nature and power of the Parliaments under the Crown of <hi>England.</hi> The Members being neither cho≈øen by the people, nor repre≈øenting them; but Lawjers, that u≈øually either purcha≈øe the≈øe places of the Crown, or pay an annual pen≈øion for the ≈øame; having no legi≈ølative power, nor indeed any other but derivative from the King, and alterable at his plea≈øure. They tell the Academy of <hi>Paris;</hi>

But let us brie≈øly run over the re≈øt. Tho≈øe 2. under the Crown of <hi>England</hi> have the election of Magi≈øtrates generally in Corporations, and ≈øome under Officers in the Country, which cannot be removed without due proce≈øs of Law. 3. Have a ≈øhare in the Judicature, by the Juries (in <hi>England</hi>) for matter of fact, together with the Kings Judges for matter of Law, and their la≈øt appeal to Parliaments. 4. The original power of rai≈øing Taxes. For the propo≈øal and grant mu≈øt come from the Commons, and the other two States only con≈øent. 5. The liberty of bearing Arms. Whereas in <hi>France,</hi> all Promotions, Governments, Judicatures and Taxes, are in the Kings power; who permits not the vulgar u≈øe of Arms, or a ≈øtanding <hi>Militia</hi> in his Kingdom; but only ≈øuch as are in his pay, and thereby entirely at his devotion. So that there is no Communalty that lives more happily than that of <hi>England,</hi> nor none more mi≈øerably than the <hi>poor pai≈øantry</hi> of <hi>France.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Hence we may infer a fair probability, of enjoying more liberty under the Crown of <hi>England</hi> than <hi>France.</hi> I know our freedom will not nece≈ø≈øarily follow from the premi≈øes; for that which is <hi>legal,</hi> will depend upon ≈øuch conditions, as ≈øhall be either previou≈øly agreed upon, or after con≈øented unto: yet I leave every one to judge, which is likelie≈øt to grant us the be≈øt; not only for our Religion, but liberty in our Per≈øons, Priviledges and E≈øtates; as al≈øo who≈øe Government is mo≈øt likely to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the ≈øame, and make us thereby al≈øo <hi>actually free.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If it be argued, that the <hi>French King</hi> may give us more liberty than his other Subjects; and the <hi>King of England</hi> le≈øs. The reply is ea≈øie; that we rea≈øon not from the power of either, or what they can and may do; but what in all appearance they will do. Although tho≈øe that hold it for a
<pb facs="tcp:56430:16"/>fundamental in the <hi>French</hi> Government, that whatever is conquered by them or acquired, mu≈øt be incorporated with the Kingdom of <hi>France;</hi> and that this is as indi≈øpen≈øable for the body politick, as the <hi>Salick Law</hi> is for the head; ≈øcruple much, whether the King <hi>de jure,</hi> can make us freer than the re≈øt of his Subjects. But we neither de≈øire to di≈øpute the Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative of Princes, much le≈øs of ≈øuch a mighty Monarch; nor indeed are we of their opinion herein, and therefore take it for granted, that he as well as the <hi>King of England,</hi> may grant us as full and ample liberty, as He ≈øhall think fit in His Royal plea≈øure. We only profe≈øs our fears what he will do, and ≈øuch as are rational and becoming men; not groundle≈øs fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, or frivolous reports, which are the u≈øual <hi>Bugbears,</hi> that affright only fearful women and children.</p>
               <p n="1">1. We cannot flatter our ≈øelves into hopes, that our condition ≈øhould be better than either of tho≈øe two Kings (which ≈øoever we ≈øubmit unto) natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Sujects. If it be equal, it is well; and all that we can rationally expect. And therefore we judge, that <hi>England</hi> will ea≈øier be induced to this, which is ordinary unto that Government; than <hi>France,</hi> to indulge us of extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary favour, unle≈øs we had merited ≈øuch a priviledge, as to be made an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception from the general rule. And that Governors under them will wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly and readily maintain, that which they are accu≈øtomed unto; but very hardly ≈øuch immunities, as tran≈øcend the bounds which are ≈øet to others.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The many examples we have before us, of ≈øuch Countries as <hi>France</hi> hath gained, keeps our fears continually waking. For by whatever Title they have been acquired, we find them all generally in the ≈øame condition. Whether by right of donation, as <hi>Daulphiny</hi> and <hi>Provence,</hi> or purcha≈øe as <hi>Berry Montpelier &amp;c.</hi> or marriage, as <hi>Bourbon, Champagne, Languedock, Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taigny, &amp;c.</hi> or by conque≈øt and powerful ≈øeizure, as <hi>Normandy, Aquitane, Poictou, Anjou,</hi> and what≈øoever held on <hi>England</hi> by <hi>Charles</hi> the ≈øeventh, and <hi>Burgundy</hi> with tho≈øe that depended thereon, by his ≈øon <hi>Lewis</hi> the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leventh; all the≈øe being incorporated with <hi>France,</hi> (what ever their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer immunities were, and whatever le≈ø≈øer they ≈øtill injoy) are all equally ≈øubject to all Laws, Governments, and Impo≈øitions from the Crown, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out di≈øpute and contradiction. And can we then be ≈øuch fools, as to think, that though we come under <hi>France,</hi> yet we ≈øhall be free? But now on the contrary we know, that what≈øoever acce≈ø≈øion hath been made to the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> either by mariiage as <hi>Scotland,</hi> or conque≈øt as <hi>Ireland,</hi> that they have all their Laws, Priviledges, Governments, and Immunities remaining entirely, as inviolable from the Crown, and unalterable with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out their own con≈øent. Nor do they only injoy the≈øe, but make Laws for ≈øupporting them, according to their particular intere≈øts; yea cro≈øs and oppo≈øite to the other, which yet are ratified by his Maje≈øty, or at lea≈øt by his Royal authority and plea≈øure.</p>
               <p n="3">3. If any have neither li≈øt nor lei≈øure, to look into the Hi≈øtories of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer times; the pre≈øent age will furni≈øh them ≈øufficiently, with examples
<pb facs="tcp:56430:16"/>both foreign and dome≈øtick. Let them enquire of <hi>Lorraign</hi> and <hi>Flanders,</hi> how they fare with their new Ma≈øters. Or let them but pa≈øs into the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jacent Provinces, and inform them≈øelves of the <hi>French</hi> Government; and then they may ≈øee as in a Gla≈øs, the face of their own future condition, And if any be re≈øolvedly blind, that they will not ≈øee, except they be deaf al≈øo, or ≈øtop their ears; they may hear enough, (if the tenth part of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports be but true) to warn them ≈øufficiently to look to them≈øelves. But if they remain ≈øo incredulous, that all the Beacons that are fired about them, makes them not fear; and that they will believe nothing, which they them≈øelves do not feel: I wi≈øh that experience (which wi≈øe men call <hi>the Mi≈øtre≈øs of Fools</hi>) convince them not of their folly, when it is too late; and their condition become ≈øo mi≈øerable, that its fitter to be drawn cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with a ≈øorrowful veil, by ≈øome <hi>Timanthes</hi>'s Pencil, than to be lively ≈øet forth in its ≈øad colours, or de≈øcribed by the Pen of an impartial Hi≈øto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian. For my part I profe≈øs that none honours the worth and gallantry of the <hi>French</hi> Nation more than my ≈øelf, yet I would loth come under its power: for the rea≈øon which the Fox gives the Lion in the Fable,</p>

We think we have rea≈øon to be afraid not only for our per≈øons, and pur≈øes; but even for our lives, and all tho≈øe things which may make us mi≈øerable; not only in regard of the <hi>French,</hi> but our <hi>≈øelves.</hi> For we know that a people accu≈øtomed to liberty, who have had enough given them and taken much more, when once they come to be re≈øtrained, and ≈øtrictly held in by the rains of Government; are very apt to break out into mutinies and mi≈øchiefs; and like wild Colts in their fir≈øt managing, ru≈øh de≈øperate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly into ruin, that they may throw their Riders. Yea when <hi>Conquerors</hi> think they have ≈øo harna≈ø≈øed the multitude, that they dare not but draw their triumphant Chariots; and doubt not but they them≈øelves ≈øit ≈øo fa≈øt, that they may drive them out of breath, and ≈øo tame them at their plea≈øure: they u≈øually <hi>Pha√´ton</hi> like, ≈øet all on fire; and if they e≈øcape the popular fury by running away in the ≈ømoak, meet with his fate, to be ≈øtruck wit the Thunderbolt of their Soveraigns ju≈øtice. Innumerable are the examples for the confirmation of this; but we will confine our ≈øelves to our own Country; and content our≈øelves with two only. When <hi>Philip</hi> the fourth had beat the <hi>Flemmings,</hi> united <hi>Flanders</hi> to <hi>France,</hi> and ≈øet Governours over them; who erected Citadels in their ≈øeveral Towns, Garri≈øoned their Citics to keep them in aw,<note place="margin">Serres in Phil. <hi>4.</hi>
                  </note> and arbitrarily charged them with great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributions; the people that were u≈øed to Freedom, would not be brought into this yoke of bondage; but de≈øperately revolt, ma≈ø≈øacre the <hi>French,</hi> and involve all in confu≈øion and mi≈øery. Nor is this all; for, (though the ba≈øer ≈øort begin, yet great men u≈øually end ≈øuch quarrels) a War fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, which co≈øt both <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Flanders</hi> dear, in the va≈øt expence both of blood and trea≈øure. And when <hi>Duke d' Alva</hi> attempted the like upon our Ance≈øtors in the≈øe <hi>Provinces,</hi> who were a free people and not u≈øed to
<pb facs="tcp:56430:17"/>≈øuch ≈øeverity; how did the ≈øparks of mutiny in the beginning break out into great flames at la≈øt, which ≈øet the whole Country on fire? No pen is able to expre≈øs the mi≈øeries of tho≈øe Times; nor Tragedy repre≈øent the things that were perpetrated.

               <head>
                  <hi>Sect. 6.</hi> The third Argument which preponderates for <hi>England,</hi> is the pre≈øervation of our E≈øtates: in regard of Souldiers vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, Governors Impo≈øitions, Publick Debts by Obligation, and Revenues of the Romi≈øh Church.</head>
               <p>WE proceed now to ≈øhew, that its better to be under <hi>England</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of our <hi>E≈øtates.</hi> Both in re≈øpect of <hi>getting</hi> them, (as I ≈øhall ≈øhew in the following Section) and the <hi>keeping</hi> tho≈øe we have gotten al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, or by the ble≈ø≈øing of <hi>God</hi> may get hereafter. And to this I give the precedency, becau≈øe the enjoyment of Riches is the end for which, and Trade only the means by which, we labour to obtain them. Now if it can be made apparent, that we can neither get, nor keep ≈øuch <hi>E≈øtates</hi> under <hi>France,</hi> as we can under <hi>England:</hi> there are none ≈øo regardle≈øs herein (what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they are of <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Liberty</hi>) but will ea≈øily grant the truth of our <hi>Conclu≈øion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. Then let us con≈øider that except we can keep that which is our own we are never the better for it, but a great deal the wor≈øe. Had we a grant of <hi>Midas</hi>'s wi≈øh, that all we touched ≈øhould be turned into gold; or were we in≈øured that all our adventures, ≈øhould bring us returns as rich as the <hi>Ea≈øt India</hi> Companies; what ≈øhould it profit us, if we could notkeep them? Nay, were we not a great deal wor≈øe than without them? What toil and anxiety is there in getting! What fears and troubles are there in keeping! and what ≈øorrow and vexation in the parting with riches! Not that I think any civil Authority, will ever take away our E≈øtates, except we forfeit them through mi≈ødemeanors; but when the <hi>Sword</hi> brings ≈øuch a <hi>Commi≈ø≈øion,</hi> I would gladly know who dare deny it? And whether the poor man then, that hath all his money in his pur≈øe-pocket; be not both fafer in his per≈øon, and more ≈øecure of his E≈øtate; than the rich Merchant, who≈øe <hi>bags</hi> and <hi>warehou≈øes</hi> are filled with his wealth? <hi>Crae≈øus</hi> was rich even to a Proverb, yet ≈øhewing to <hi>Solon</hi> all his Trea≈øures, <hi>Solon</hi> told him, <hi>that if any came with better iron than he wore, they would be ma≈øter of all that Gold.</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:56430:17"/>Now in regard of plundring, depedrations, and all manner of violence by Souldiers both to our per≈øons and e≈øtates; I think we are far more ≈øecure from the <hi>Engli≈øh,</hi> than <hi>French.</hi> And for this, I ≈øhall appeal to the <hi>Common experience</hi> of all ages and places where their Armies have come; which bear witne≈øs, to the great exorbitances of the latter, more than the other; in the violation both of womens cha≈øtity and mens e≈øtates, and frequent de≈øolations by fire and ≈øword. Yea I will make their own Hi≈øtorian <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines</hi> judge of the controver≈øie, who having ≈øhown, how unju≈øtly great ones govern, and the innocent people are oppre≈øt,<note place="margin">

Whereas on the contrary, he ≈øays <hi>England</hi> excel'd them all, in the≈øe three particulars; <hi>re≈øpect to the common good, the peoples freedom from in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury, and the little ≈øpoil their Souldiers and Armies made in their Wars;</hi> the la≈øt whereof he repeats, and enlarges a little after in the ≈øame Chapter.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But we will ≈øuppo≈øe the be≈øt in all <hi>uncertainties,</hi> and therefore hope we ≈øhall e≈øcape all plundering, and violence from the Souldiers in a time of confu≈øion; and make no doubt thereof, in a ≈øetled condition. But yet we know we ≈øhall not e≈øcape paying ≈øuch Taxes, as indeed ju≈øtly deter us, both in regard of their <hi>greatne≈øs,</hi> and al≈øo the <hi>arbitrarines</hi> of their Impo≈øition. In both which we know no people in <hi>Europe</hi> more mi≈øerable than <hi>France,</hi> nor none happier in the contrary, than the Subjects of the Crown of <hi>England.</hi> Which partly occa≈øioned that known ≈øaying of the Emperour <hi>Maximilian</hi> the fir≈øt, that he was <hi>Rex regum,</hi> the King of <hi>Spain Rex ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minum,</hi> the King of <hi>France Rex a≈øinorum,</hi> and the King of <hi>England Rex diabolorum.</hi> For he could have nothing but what the <hi>Germain Prince≈øs</hi> con≈øented to, <hi>Spain</hi> only what the Laws allowed him; <hi>France</hi> all that he plea≈øed; and <hi>England</hi> nothing that plea≈øed not the people.</p>
               <p>As touching their <hi>greatne≈øs.</hi> 1.

                  </note> which is lately ≈øhown us in our own Language. That their <hi>Armies</hi> are often numerous; and ≈øome always nece≈ø≈øary, both for defence of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from their dome≈øtick enemies, and of the Frontiers from foreign, in the adjacent Countries. And that the≈øe require va≈øt ≈øums to ≈øupport them. Yet notwith≈øtanding, thirdly, <hi>Moderation</hi> ought to be u≈øed, ≈øo that the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon people may enjoy the fruit of their labours. But to ≈øhew how far the Government of <hi>France</hi> hath been from this, would be an endle≈øs work. We ≈øhould but tire our ≈øelves to read, what their own Hi≈øtorians have rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; and be weary with the rehear≈øal, of the many tumults and rebellions that have ari≈øen from their <hi>gabels.</hi> It would fill any one with <hi>≈øorrow</hi> to hear of the great <hi>complaints</hi> and <hi>out cries,</hi> that the people have made in former
<pb facs="tcp:56430:18"/>Ages; and fright us to hear tho≈øe of the pre≈øent: which yet their Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors are ≈øo u≈øed to, that they count them but the old <hi>fa fa</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> and oppre≈ø≈øion the ≈øin of the old World. What remor≈øe of Con≈øcience ≈øeveral of their Kings have had for their extortion, is well known to tho≈øe that have read their Hi≈øtories. Some in their life time as <hi>Charles</hi> the eighth; ≈øome at their death as <hi>Philip</hi> the fourth, who remitted the Taxes he had un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ju≈øtly required, and commanded his Sons to ea≈øe the people. But above all <hi>Lewis</hi> the eleventh, who re≈øolved to reform, but it was too late; and therefore charged the <hi>Dauphin</hi> again≈øt that oppre≈ø≈øion he had practi≈øed. And indeed it was highly nece≈ø≈øary; for he had reduced the common peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to ≈øuch poverty, that many of the Farmers were forced, with halters a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout their necks to draw their own Plows; except they would ≈øteal, and once for all, ≈øtretch both them≈øelves and ropes on the Gallows. But I ≈øhould not once mention any of the≈øe things, if I thought it not better for us, both to know and believe them before hand, than experience them af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards to our co≈øt. For I fear if we come once under the <hi>French,</hi> there will be no end of paying contributions; until we be brought into the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the <hi>Andrians</hi> of old,<note place="margin">Plut. in vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta Themi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtocl. ex Herodoto.</note> who when <hi>Themi≈øtocles</hi> demanded money telling them he had brought two <hi>Godde≈ø≈øes</hi> to require it, <hi>per≈øwa≈øion &amp; pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er;</hi> an≈øwered that they had two great <hi>Godde≈ø≈øes</hi> al≈øo who taught them to deny it, which were <hi>poverty</hi> and <hi>impo≈ø≈øibility.</hi> And then the <hi>Hollanders</hi> may do that living,<note place="margin">Procopius decad. <hi>6.</hi> lib. <hi>6.</hi>

<pb facs="tcp:56430:18"/>of Kings) that there ≈øhall never ari≈øe a <hi>Rehoboam</hi> out of <hi>Lewis</hi>'s race; yea that this is as impo≈ø≈øible, as for a Vulture to ri≈øe out of the Phoenix a≈øhes: yet we know the be≈øt of Kings may have bad Governors under them; and that they mu≈øt often, both ≈øee with other eys, and hear with other ears than their own. Yea let us ≈øuppo≈øe, that we ≈øhall never pay more Tribute to the fair <hi>Lillies</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> than we have done to the <hi>Belgick Lion;</hi> except that of re≈øpect, which we acknowledge his due: yet there ≈øtill remains a va≈øt difference, betwixt a <hi>legal</hi> and a <hi>permi≈ø≈øive exemption,</hi> and of the ≈øame payments made by <hi>publick con≈øent,</hi> and tho≈øe that are commanded by ab≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute <hi>power;</hi> though not in regard of the money, yet in regard both of the authority that requires it, which if ab≈øolute and arbitrary is alterable, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it ≈øhould not be altered; and the different impre≈ø≈øions which they make, and effects that follow in the minds and affections of men. For when a people know the nece≈ø≈øities of State, and freely vote their own Contributions, they account them≈øelves free and uninjured though the Taxations be never ≈øo great, (according to the rule, that <hi>volenti non fit in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juria:</hi>) and look upon them as a gift rather than a debt, and therefore pay them willingly, and generou≈øly bear their parting with their ≈øhare, Whereas on the contrary, when they are ignorant of the grounds of ≈øuch impo≈øitions, they are always jealous, that they are not ≈øo great as is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended; and when they have no ≈øuffrage therein, look upon them≈øelves as wronged and oppre≈ø≈øed; and though they pay them, yet it is with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luctancy; and becau≈øe they mu≈øt and cannot with≈øtand it, their minds are dejected, and their ≈øpirit and courage ≈øtrangely depre≈øt, as I could ≈øhew by many examples.

               </p>
               <p n="3">3. There is another con≈øideration, which is of great importance to the Inhabitants of the≈øe Countries and that is concerning their <hi>Debts.</hi> For mentioning E≈øtates, we mean not only that in our own, but al≈øo that in
<pb facs="tcp:56430:19"/>other mens hands. As for <hi>Private debts,</hi> we know they mu≈øt needs be very many and great in places of ≈øuch Merchandi≈øe; ≈øeeing the greate≈øt part of trade is all over, and here e≈øpecially, driven upon credit. Now how the≈øe will be gotten, if bad time come on, ≈øo that many remove, and more be impoveri≈øhed; I leave tho≈øe to con≈øider, who≈øe concernment it is. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Publick debts,</hi> (which are yet more de≈øperate, whatever change happens) they are ≈øuch as are contracted, either for <hi>Service</hi> to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth, and <hi>Commodities</hi> delivered for publick u≈øes; or for <hi>Monies</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on obligation; all which ways many thou≈øands are greatly concerned, e≈øpecially the la≈øt. There being very many, who have lent, ≈øome a good part, and others the greate≈øt part of their E≈øtates, upon the <hi>publick faith</hi> of the <hi>Land, Cities</hi> and <hi>Lombards</hi> of the≈øe Provinces. So that if this <hi>publick faith</hi> prove <hi>faithle≈øs</hi> like the <hi>Punick</hi> of old, a great number of Families, and (which is mo≈øt deplorable) Widows and Orphans, (who being uncapable to imploy their E≈øtates thus intru≈øted them) will be wholly ruined and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done. Herein I think all that have any ≈øen≈øe of ju≈øtice and equity, will conclude with me.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That it is very unrea≈øonable and unju≈øt, that if the pre≈øent Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment cannot di≈øcharge the≈øe debts, or a change happens; that tho≈øe who have credited the Republick, ≈øhould ≈øit down with all the lo≈øs, and others not bear their proportion.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That ≈øeeing they were lent to the Publick, and Obligation accordingly given; and that for publick u≈øes, and ≈øo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed, (or if other-ways converted, yet without the Creditors fault:) it is all the rea≈øon in the world, that the Publick ≈øhould faithfully pay the ≈øame.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That if the Republick ≈øtand, care ought to be taken to ≈øatistic the≈øe Creditors: and that if a change of Government happen, the people remaining the ≈øame, are both in Law and equity liable to pay the≈øe debts. For though it is a great que≈øtion how far Subjects are obliged to pay their Soveraigns; yet it was never que≈øtioned by any, but that ≈øuch as are made for the Publick by the peoples tacit, and much more expre≈øs con≈øent; mu≈øt be paid by the people, what ever change be made in the Government. Whether from a Monarchy to a Republick,<note place="margin">Demo≈øthen adv. Lep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin. V. Di≈øqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øit. politic. <hi>53.</hi>
                  </note> as the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munality of <hi>Athens</hi> paid the 100 Talents which their 30 Tyrants had bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed of the <hi>Lacedemonians;</hi> and the≈øe very Provinces, that which the King of <hi>Spain</hi> was indebted to the people: Or from a Republick to a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy; <hi>Non de≈øinit debere pecuniam populus rege ≈øibi impo≈øito, quam liber debebat; e≈øt enim idem populus, &amp; dominium retinet eorum quae populi fuerant; im√≤ &amp; imperium in≈øe retinet, quanquam jam non exercendum √† corpore ≈øed √† capite,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Grotius de jure belli &amp; pacis, l.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 9. <hi>Sect.</hi> 8.

               <p>All the <hi>difficulty</hi> therefore will be if a <hi>change come,</hi> how the <hi>payment</hi> of the≈øe ju≈øt debts may be procured. And here we need no other <hi>Coun≈øellors</hi> advice, than our own rea≈øon, which will inform us, that the freer any people are
<pb facs="tcp:56430:20"/>and the more they participate of power; the more probable it is, and al≈øo the more facile for them to obtain their rights. Now that we are likely to have more freedom under <hi>England</hi> than <hi>France,</hi> I have ≈øhewn ≈øufficiently in the former Section. Yea common experience as well as rea≈øon hath learnt the world this le≈ø≈øon; that when inferiors can only pray and peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, they may daily get fair promi≈øes, and perhaps be ≈øprinkled with ≈øome <hi>Court-holy-water;</hi> but performances and payments are ≈øtill the work of to morrow, and continually kept as <hi>re≈øerves</hi> in the <hi>rear.</hi> Nor can they biing more arguments for their expedition, than Superiors have excu≈øes for their delaying: and if at la≈øt their patience be worn as thread-bare, as their clothes with attendance; ≈øo that they become importune in reque≈øt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; then <hi>Grandees</hi> grow deaf in hearing, and re≈øolvedly peremptory in denying: whence both ≈øides frequently fall to irregular proceedings; the one for recovering, and the other for defrauding them of their rights. Whereas tho≈øe that can, not only reque≈øt, but al≈øo legally require, that ju≈øtice be done; have ground to hope, that when the touchines of times is over, and the boi≈øterous pa≈ø≈øions of great ones are laid; ≈øome happy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juncture of affairs may prove a pro≈øperous gale to bring them at la≈øt, their hazardous adventures home in ≈øafety.</p>
               <p n="4">4. and la≈øtly, (that I may draw this arrow to the head) I ≈øhall de≈øire that we may con≈øider a little of the Lands and Revenues, formerly belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the <hi>Romi≈øh Church.</hi> Which to defend our ≈øelves in our Wars with <hi>Spain,</hi> were ≈øold to ≈øeveral, and are ≈øince parcelled out into many more hands. Now the very mentioning of this I ≈øhould think ≈øufficient; the difference between <hi>France</hi> and <hi>England</hi> herein, being ≈øo well known. Do we hear what the former hath already done, in all tho≈øe places ≈øubject to him, and how they have ≈øet up all the Romi≈øh rable; and can we think that they will not in time recover (what ever promi≈øes they pa≈øs for the pre≈øent) that which not only they them≈øelves, but all of their Religion account their right? Can we imagine that their <hi>Bi≈øhops, Abbots, Priors,</hi> and other Superior Orders, will live like <hi>Parochials</hi> or <hi>Mendicant Friers?</hi> Who is ≈øo ignorant as knows not, that where ever the <hi>old Gentleman of Rome</hi> comes to rule, he brings with him many attendants to bear up his train; and that their pomp mu≈øt be ≈øupported, though many <hi>Gentlemen</hi> thereby be ruined? Whereas on the contrary, <hi>England</hi> is by them, in the ≈øame condemnation with our ≈øelves; neither permitting his head≈øhip and dominion over them, nor his members and followers any demains among them. So that we may ≈øafely conclude, that all tho≈øe that po≈ø≈øes ≈øuch E≈øtates, as the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> doth challenge; can neither rationally hope to keep them under <hi>France,</hi> nor fear to lo≈øe them under <hi>England.</hi>

               </head>
               <p>WE are now come to the <hi>Acropolis</hi> of the cau≈øe; <hi>Trade</hi> being the great <hi>Tower of ≈øtrength,</hi> to which the Adver≈øaries of our opinion, having de≈øerted the former out-works, u≈øually ≈øly unto our refuge. We ≈øhall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore per≈øue them; but orderly, fir≈øt making our <hi>approaches</hi> by degrees; and them rai≈øing ≈øuch batteries, and planting ≈øuch <hi>rea≈øons,</hi> as are forcible, either to beat this down, or at lea≈øt make ≈øuch breaches therein, as ≈øhall render it untenable for their defence; and ≈øo compel the mo≈øt pertinacious of our enemies, either to ≈øubmit, or to fall before us.</p>
               <p>But before we begin this work, we mu≈øt acquaint you, that when we mention <hi>Trade,</hi> we mean not every particular kind of negotiation, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the ≈øeveral ≈øorts of Artificers and Shop-keepers are imployed; to ≈øpeak of which would be both an endle≈øs, an a bootle≈øs work. Herein perhaps ≈øome might fare better with the <hi>French,</hi> the <hi>Mercers</hi> and <hi>Tailers</hi> e≈øpecially; for the <hi>√† la mode Mon≈øieurs</hi> when they have money, affect to change their fa≈øhion as often as the <hi>Moon</hi> doth her face; and to wear as many ribbands on their breeches, as ordinary Pedlers bear on their backs; as if all the fortunes of <hi>France</hi> hung at their ends, and all their own happine≈øs followed their heels. And happily <hi>Butchers</hi> and <hi>Cooks</hi> would fare better with the <hi>Engli≈øh,</hi> for a <hi>piece of good Beef</hi> or a <hi>Shoulder of Mutton.</hi> And we might in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtance in many others with merriment; but we have no mind to be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øant upon ≈øo ≈øerious a Subject. In ≈øhort therefore, we mean <hi>Maritime Trade</hi> (as our Adver≈øaries do) this being the great <hi>Diana</hi> of the <hi>Nether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands,</hi> which brings them in their Silver Shrines.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Then we ≈øhall lay down this as a fundamental and undoubted <hi>Maxim,</hi> (which all I think will take for granted) that <hi>trade by Sea is the great ≈øecular intere≈øt of the≈øe Provinces, the Maritime e≈øpecially, by which they mo≈øt flouri≈øh, and without which they cannot ≈øub≈øi≈øt.</hi> Let <hi>Am≈øterdam</hi> and the other <hi>Cities</hi> be as rich, or richer then they are imagined; yet will they in a few years, if their Trade be ob≈øtructed, become as poor as their Neighbours at <hi>Gant,</hi> or <hi>Antwerp.</hi> For who will build at ≈øuch exce≈ø≈øive charges (where the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation ≈øometimes is half to the ≈øuper≈øtructure) or pay ≈øuch rents for their habitation, and live in ≈øuch expen≈øive places, if there be not freedom of Trade? But tho≈øe that can, will remove; ≈øome hither and ≈øome thither, as their intere≈øt and affection ≈øhall incline them;<note place="margin">E≈ø≈øay (or Sermo fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delis) <hi>19.</hi>
                  </note> rather then ≈øpend their <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitalls</hi> here. If ever Merchants were, or are in any place of the world, the <hi>vena porta</hi> (as <hi>Bacon</hi> ≈øtiles them) of any publick body, it is certainly the

                  <hi>Belgick.</hi> If they fraight not their Ships, whereby the Marriners may be imployed; if they furni≈øh not the Trade≈ømen ≈øhops, whereby they may follow their Vocations; if they lade not the poor mens backs, whereby their Families may fill their bellies; finally, if they di≈øtribute not their Merchandi≈øe through the various Seas and Rivers of the <hi>

               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Merchandi≈øe being our chief concernment, it will nece≈ø≈øarily follow that that Nation that can mo≈øt ob≈øtruct the ≈øame, can do us mo≈øt injury. Now that <hi>England</hi> can do this more than <hi>France,</hi> or any other what≈øoever, I think none will deny; if any do, there is enough ≈øaid hereafter, that will make it ≈øufficiently apparent.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Of all our neighbouring Nations, <hi>England</hi> being mo≈øt potent by Sea, and <hi>France</hi> by Land, it will clearly follow, that a Peace with the≈øe two above all others, is our great concernment, With the former for getting, and with the latter for keeping and enjoying our E≈øtates. But if we cannot have this from them both, which of them is to be preferred comes next in con≈øideration.</p>
               <p n="4">4. This Common-wealth con≈øi≈øting of <hi>Maritime</hi> and <hi>Inland Provinces,</hi> the former being by far the mo≈øt con≈øiderable, the friend≈øhip of <hi>England</hi> is more to be valued than that of <hi>France.</hi> And this the wi≈øe≈øt men that this <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick</hi> ever had, formerly never doubted. of Prince <hi>William</hi> the Fir≈øt founder of this Common-wealth, laid down the≈øe three principal maximes of State, which were approved by all, as ≈øound and rational beyond contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction.
<list>
                     <item>1. <hi>To do ju≈øtice to Strangers.</hi> For great Nations may be upheld by Power, but ≈ømall Territories mu≈øt be maintained by Ju≈øtice.</item>
                     <item>2. <hi>To hold a fair corre≈øpondence with France.</hi> For <hi>Spain</hi> being then the grand <hi>Monarchy</hi> of <hi>Europe,</hi> and our dreadful enemy; the a≈ø≈øi≈øtance of <hi>France</hi> was greatly ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈ø≈øary for our ≈øupportation.</item>
                     <item>3. <hi>To pre≈øerve an inviolable Peace with England,</hi> In regard that this is ab≈øolutely requi≈øite for our freedom of Commerceby Sea; and the <hi>Engli≈øh</hi> were our friends in affection as well as Intere≈øt, whereas the <hi>French</hi> only upon the latter account. For the greate≈øt ob≈øtacle that ≈øtood in the way of <hi>France</hi>'s greatne≈øs, was the <hi>Spani≈øh</hi> power in the≈øe <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therlands;</hi> which being once broke down, they well knew they could dilate their Empire at their plea≈øure, as we ≈øee it now to our ≈øorrow. It is true of later times, the <hi>Love≈øteiners</hi> to free them≈øelves, from the Head≈øhip of the <hi>Orange</hi> family; which ≈øought (as they imagined) either an ab≈øolutene≈øs, or at lea≈øt to infringe the liberty of the Common-wealth, have been rather inclined to <hi>France</hi> and <hi>England:</hi> but they were not ≈øo blinded with pa≈ø≈øion, but that having a Peace with <hi>Spain,</hi> and being ≈øen≈øible of <hi>France's</hi> prevalen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and rai≈øing their Fortunes upon the <hi>Spani≈øh</hi> ruines, it was their Intere≈øt to comply with <hi>England</hi> rather than <hi>France.</hi> Which plainly appears, in that no ≈øooner was tho≈øe unhappy differences between us and <hi>England</hi>

               </p>
               <p n="5">5. To the rea≈øon of State already mentioned, together with the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our greate≈øt <hi>Politicians</hi> both in former and later times, let me add; that Terre≈øtrial war hath always been accounted more eligible than a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val; yea by ≈øome our ab≈øolute intere≈øt, as the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Rhoan</hi> ob≈øerves.

If we had the Sea free for our inferior <hi>Provinces,</hi> the charges of a Land-war for the ≈øuperior were ea≈øily borne. And we ≈øhould not want men enow for our money, to fight for them with <hi>France,</hi> or any other what≈øoever, ≈øo long as we ≈øhould think them worth the fighting for. Nor let any wonder that I in≈øert ≈øuch a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional; for I ≈øhall afterwards make it appear, how the Common-wealth may be well ≈øecured, though the≈øe Provinces ≈øhould be let go or lo≈øt. And as for the inferior, they are ≈øo ≈øituated in the water, and thereby ≈øo inacce≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øible; that we need not fear, what all the force of <hi>France</hi> can do, if we be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øolved to defend them. It being therefore apparent that Traffick is our principal concernment, and <hi>England</hi> of all others mo≈øt able to ob≈øtruct it; we may conclude in point of intere≈øt, as Prince <hi>Maurice</hi> (I have heard) u≈øed to ≈øay, that <hi>were the Engli≈øh Devils, we mu≈øt have peace with them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The≈øe being the <hi>Approaches,</hi> (which I think) no ≈øallies of our Adver≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries can prevent; we ≈øhall now, being got nearer them, take a better view of their ≈øtrength. Were we free and had our choice, whether we ≈øhould war with <hi>France</hi> or <hi>England,</hi> you ≈øee our intere≈øt ≈øhould carry us again≈øt <hi>France.</hi> But the ca≈øe (alas!) is far otherwi≈øe with us, for they both make war upon us: by what error of policy one of them, which could be≈øt, was not taken off and diverted, if it had been po≈ø≈øible, or whether it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈ø≈øible, and ≈øo no error or omi≈ø≈øion in us, is not now our enquiry. But ≈øee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they both threaten us with de≈øtruction, upon ≈øuppo≈øition that we are unable any longer to re≈øi≈øt them both, whether of them we ≈øhould choo≈øe to be under in regard of our <hi>Trade.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This then being the Que≈øtion; our Adver≈øaries give their ≈øuffrage for <hi>France;</hi> and think them≈øelves impregnable in this point of intere≈øt.

               <p n="1">1. It is better for us, ≈øay they, to be under <hi>France,</hi> becau≈øe <hi>England</hi> and and we are Competitors for Trade.</p>
               <p>It is very true, <hi>England</hi> and the≈øe Countries by their ≈øituation, genious, and intere≈øt are ≈øet for Trade: and this naturally begets an enmity between us, and a vying with one another for the ≈øame. But this was always, and will be ≈øo whil≈øt men are men: and what will follow hence? Surely one of the≈øe things, either that we mu≈øt willingly yield to them, or they to us, which is madne≈øs to imagine; or that we mu≈øt fight with them for the whole, which if they mean of our ≈øelves, is the next degree to dotage, ≈øeeing we are about matches, and Peace in their trade is always the intere≈øt of a trading people; if they mean jointly with <hi>France,</hi> we ≈øhall ≈øpeak to that in the following Argument, and ≈øhew what a hazard even that will be, and much more ≈øingly: or that we mu≈øt compound with them for our ≈øhare, that ≈øo each Nation may have, what Gods ble≈ø≈øing may give, and their own indu≈øtry may procure them. And this in my opinion will have the vote, not only of all the Cowards, but all the wi≈øe men of both Nations. But becau≈øe this Argument is much in≈øi≈øted on, both in former times and this juncture of affairs; we will more particularly con≈øider the ≈øame, in reference to this Common-wealth as to <hi>England</hi> ab≈øolutely without re≈øpect to <hi>France.</hi> And thereby we ≈øhall ≈øee what corrivals in Trade implies in point of Intere≈øt, whether the power be about equal, (as we ≈øhall here ≈øup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øe <hi>England</hi> and this Common-wealths) or unequal, and in point of infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence. Now in regard of Intere≈øt, we ≈øhall find in my judgment, that 'tis clearly this for us as equal in power.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That we mu≈øt vigorou≈øly defend our Trade, as that on which our temporal welfare depends.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That we mu≈øt for this purpo≈øe, maintain a naval power, equal at lea≈øt to theirs. That ≈øo we may hold them up, to the ju≈øt and due terms, and bounds, of Commerce and Navigation.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That for this end the league of the Maritime Provinces be kept in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>violable. If the band of the bunch of arrows be either cut or broken, ≈øo that they fall out of the Lions paw; he will ≈øoon have his skin pull'd over his ears. So that to make ≈øeveral Common-wealths of them, is but to make them ≈øo many mor≈øels to be the ea≈øilier devoured by their enemies. And therefore I wonder at the Author of the <hi>Intere≈øt of Holland</hi> herein, who, <hi>c.</hi> 41.42. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> a≈ø≈øerts the power of that Province ≈øufficient by Sea, and jointly with <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>trecht</hi> by Land, to wage War with all other Potentates. Seeing the≈øe Maritime Provinces entirely con≈øidered, are but the match at Sea for <hi>England.</hi> And the rea≈øons that he gives, <hi>c.</hi> 37. are now refuted by experience. I acknowledge it al≈øo an error in policy, for <hi>Zeeland</hi> to break this bond of Amity, if po≈ø≈øibly they can help it. But if their Enemies ≈øword cuts this a≈øunder, what ≈øhall they do? And this is the ca≈øe only that I defend.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That we ≈øhould rather yield to them in <hi>Punctillioes</hi> of honour; that
<pb facs="tcp:56430:22"/>being a <hi>Crown,</hi> this only a Common-wealth. Such I mean as the <hi>Flag;</hi> although I reckon not that any di≈øhonour to us, ≈øeeing they have not only always challenged it, but our Ance≈øtors al≈øo given it: and other Nations as well as we, pay the ≈øame acknowledgment to that <hi>Crown.</hi> The fir≈øt time that we have ever refu≈øed it, was in the time of King <hi>James;</hi> the circum≈øtances whereof Sr. <hi>Anthony Welden</hi> in his <hi>Court</hi> relates, and the effects both their and our Hi≈øtorians. It is not my de≈øign to ≈øpeak of this particular, which would ≈øwell to a di≈øcour≈øe larger then this whole Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti≈øe; but only in≈øtance therein, as a known example; concluding that if they will War for it, it is our wi≈ødom to yield it, and except we were far ≈øtronger than they, folly to fight for it.</p>

                  <item>1. What either we or <hi>England</hi> have gotten by our former Wars, when matcht in power.

Let's but reckon (as we mu≈øt if we go rightly to work) the <hi>lucrum ce≈ø≈øens,</hi> and <hi>damnum emergens,</hi> or the profit that cea≈øes, and lo≈øs that accrues, and vvhat vve have got, vve may put in our eye, and not ≈øee much the vvor≈øe,
<pb facs="tcp:56430:23"/>
                     <p>But if any one ≈øay who can reckon that, or how?</p>
                     <p>I ≈øhall freely acknowledge that to pounds and per≈øons we cannot, nor no man alive; yet in the general we may, ≈øo far as to make a judgment. I have done it for my own ≈øatisfaction, and ≈øhall tell you how; that ≈øo tho≈øe that are curious may ≈øatisfy them≈øelves therein, and not take it upon my credit. By the publick Cu≈øtoms; the Number of ≈øhips, the Capital where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with Trade is driven; and by the riches of the Merchants. Of the≈øe, the two former are more ea≈øie and certain, wherein <hi>England</hi> hath increa≈øed: the two latter more conjectural, wherein this Republick hath the ≈øuperiori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. But hath not gotten it by the wars, but ari≈øes from ≈øeveral other cau≈øes, (which I could mention) and e≈øpecially from the≈øe two following, which I think will ≈øatisfy any intelligent man. As to the Capital, ours comes to be greater, in regard that as the Merchants grow rich in <hi>England,</hi> they buy land, and breed up their ≈øons to be Country gentlemen; whereas we, e≈øpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in <hi>Holland,</hi> continue the ≈øtock and our children in the Trade. Land being here at 35 and 40 years purcha≈øe, and in <hi>England</hi> at 15 or 20 ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily. And that the Merchants here ≈øhould be richer than there, is no wonder to me; who know ≈øo well the frugality of the one, and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digality of the other.</p>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. Let it be con≈øidered how difficult and hazardous it is for equal powers, to de≈øtroy one another; and therefore how litle likelihood there is, of any thing to be gotten by conte≈øting. Nay there are ≈øeveral circum≈øtances in our ≈øituations, imployments, and people, that render ab≈øolute conque≈øt almo≈øt impo≈ø≈øible. We may like Cooks fight, and breath, and fight again, and crow over one another for ≈øome victories, but far from a conque≈øt. And this we might both have ≈øeen long ≈øince in the glas of policy: which clearly ≈øhows, that ≈øuch equal powers fighting for profit, is but like <hi>Nero's</hi> fi≈øhing with a golden hook, wherein more is adventured, than ever is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be gotten. We have had a Comick-tragedy, and a tragick comedy of two wars, and <hi>England</hi> the contrary; wherein our enemies indeed have been plea≈øant ≈øpectators, and ≈øatisfied their envious eyes, but what have either of us got, but blowes? Pa≈ø≈øion and prejudice are ≈øo prevalent in the World, and ≈øo blind the eyes of men, that often they will not ≈øee the truth, till dear-bought experience makes them even to feel it. And this we now both ≈øee, and therefore <hi>England</hi> takes this opportunity of breaking down the equality of power, and bringing us lower, that ≈øo we may truckle un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them, and they be at re≈øt in the bed of ≈øecurity.</item>
                  <item>3. Tho≈øe that are ≈øo much for <hi>Mars,</hi> might do well to con≈øider, the advantages and di≈øadvantages of both Nations, for carrying on, and ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øi≈øting under long wars. In ≈øome things we may happily have the advantage, as in bearing the charges, number of ≈øhipping, Caping by Letters of Marque &amp;c.

When Trade ≈øtands ≈øtill, they have cloths for the back, and meat for the belly, better cheap for the poorer people: here not only ≈øuch accommodations are far dearer than there, which can well be born when Trade flouri≈øheth; but when that is ≈øtopt, and it can wor≈øt be endured, then are they deare≈øt of all. Our Seamen which come mo≈øt from the Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern quarters about the <hi>Baltick</hi> Sea, to ≈øerve us in Navigation; when they ≈øee no hopes of gain, but only venturing their lives for the pay of the Wars, will remove and ≈øerve other Nations: whereas the King of <hi>England</hi> hath three Kingdoms to pre≈øs out for his a≈ø≈øi≈øtance, according to the cu≈øtom of the Crown there, which is not practi≈øed nor indeed practicable in this Free State. And although at the fir≈øt ≈øuch as are pre≈øt be aver≈øe to the Wars; yet we find and feel by experience, that what through the Officers and Gentlemens care≈ø≈øing and encouraging them, what through company and conver≈øing with others before-hand, this re≈øtine≈øs is worn off by degrees; and through the principles of ≈øelf defence, and ≈øome ≈øparks of the honour of their Country, they fight well enough, whatever the cau≈øe or the quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel be.</item>
                  <item>4. I wi≈øh both Nations would well con≈øider, whether whil≈øt we two are ≈øo eagerly conte≈øting for Trade, others may not carry it away. I have rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øonably con≈øidered what Nation can bid the fare≈øt for this, in regard of their <hi>Situation, Havens, Genious, &amp;c.</hi> the ad vantages of the <hi>Mediterranean</hi> and <hi>Baltick</hi> Seas, and let my thoughts ≈øtretch them≈øelves as far as both the <hi>Indies:</hi> have ob≈øerved the <hi>French</hi> Fleet, the darling of the King and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, their hopes with the grounds of them, and the probable ≈øucce≈øs there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, as al≈øo the communication of <hi>Spain</hi> with <hi>America;</hi> and find no one Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion alone capacitated to carry away our Commerce; but ≈øeveral to have greater ≈øhares than they have at pre≈øent. Yea, to ≈øpeak my mind freely, I have had far further contemplations, and of a far different kind from the≈øe upon this Subject, in re≈øpect to future times. And indeed ≈øuch as have often made me both very ≈øorrowful to ≈øee the Chri≈øtian world ≈øo mad and quarel≈øom about their Commerce, and very fearful that God would either bla≈øt it to us, by taking it away and giving it to <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Heathens;</hi> or not ble≈øs us with it, giving us herein our hearts de≈øire in his wrath, and them the Go≈øpel in exchange thereof. As I clearly ≈øee he hath done to the <hi>Jews,</hi> the generalle≈øt and greate≈øt Merchants of the World: and as I think he threatens us Chri≈øtians in ≈øeveral places of <hi>holy Scripture,</hi> if they be du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly con≈øidered. But becau≈øe I love not dogmatizing, or to be po≈øitive in things I am not ≈øo fully ≈øatisfied in; I ≈øhall at pre≈øent ≈øay no more of this, but leave it to every good Chri≈øtians con≈øideration.</item>

Now all the≈øe have many particulars conteined in them. For example in the fir≈øt to gain time, by ≈øending Emba≈ø≈øadors, and ≈øo ≈øtill that as one is returning another may be ≈øent: whereby a fair pretence of ignorance of tran≈øactions may be pleaded, and time ≈øpun out in further debates.

The rea≈øon of the ca≈øe is ≈øo clear, that were it not for mens pa≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øions, inferiors in power would not be ≈øo ready to fight. For let them either be beaten or beat, it will redound at la≈øt to their own de≈øtruction. If the former, why ≈øhould they ≈øpend their blood and trea≈øure to make them≈øelves more mi≈øerable? and if the latter, they do but enrage their enemies the more, who being more powerful will not for two or three Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tells end the War, and come to a Peace to their great di≈øhonour. So that we may lay down this as a general rule for the weaker ≈øide, <hi>That ≈øelf defence mu≈øt be fir≈øt for preparation, but la≈øt for execution.</hi> Of all the Princes of <hi>Europe</hi> in our age, the Duke of <hi>Lorraign</hi> hath been the cunninge≈øt game<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øter, but the foule≈øt player with ≈øtronger powers.

Of the former age the <hi>Verinians,</hi> who
<pb facs="tcp:56430:24"/>being oppre≈øt by their Neighbours the <hi>Venetians,</hi> that were more power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, would notwith≈øtanding needs War with them; wherein though they were often victorious, yet it proved their ruine at la≈øt, for which they are ≈øtigmatized for Fools to all ≈øucceeding Generations. And many other examples might be produced, but I think them needle≈øs in ≈øo plain a ca≈øe.</p>
               <p>And thus you ≈øee what our being competitors for Trade implies as to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tere≈øt in regard of War and Peace. Which I have been the larger upon, becau≈øe I know what work fools make wi≈øe men in both Nations. I have many times been put to it for patience, and ≈øometimes into a Paroxi≈øm of pa≈ø≈øion, to hear the ≈øen≈øle≈øs clamors of men. We are Competitors for Trade! It is our Intere≈øt! Our Intere≈øt! Down with the <hi>Dutch!</hi> Down with the <hi>Engli≈øh!</hi> Let us but con≈øider who the≈øe are, and we ≈øhall find them. Men that have a pound of pa≈ø≈øion, for one ounce of rea≈øon. Men that never ≈øaw, or at le≈øt not well ob≈øerved both Nations. Men that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be≈øtowed one calm hour to ballance their powers. For wi≈øe men that knew both well, was but grieved to hear, or plea≈øantly merry with ≈øuch madne≈øs. I publickly decryed ≈øuch folly in the fir≈øt Wars, and had ≈øeverely cha≈øti≈øed ≈øuch fools in the ≈øecond, if I had not been ≈øeveral ways hindred. Let me ≈øay it freely (I think I have ≈øome rea≈øon, for I believe there are few men that have better viewed both Nations with their eye, to that end which I have had, nor ballanced their power with greater accuracy) that if either the King of Great <hi>Britain,</hi> or the States, or both require it: I am ready to demon≈øtrate, that for the≈øe 20 or 30 years la≈øt pa≈øt, there was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of advantage rationally to be expected on either ≈øide, that can coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervail a War: nor as both might manage their power, likely to be, ≈øo long as both continued in that condition, for in powers about equal, all the difference is in the management thereof. And becau≈øe I ≈øee what work is made in the world, if I live to ≈øee the ballance come ≈øo even again, (though I think I never ≈øhall) I do here engage, for the publick peace of Prote≈øtants, and good of both Nations, to ≈øatisfie all rational men herein, I hope even to curio≈øity. And ≈øhall, if God ≈øpares me life and health, defend the ≈øame, again≈øt all the State-tinkers of both Nations; although I well know, they have great ≈øtore of ≈ømall Tools, with which they make a ratling in their Budgets.</p>
               <p>Let us now proceed to ≈øuch inferences as our Adver≈øaries make from this competition in Trade.</p>
               <p>Some argue thus, the <hi>Engli≈øh</hi> minding Trade more than the <hi>French,</hi> they may come and live among us and carry away our Commerce.</p>
               <p>In my apprehen≈øion, there's more fear of their Souldiers coming hither than their Merchants. But ≈øuppo≈øe more Merchants did come, would that be any wor≈øe for us? I have heard ≈øeveral of the greate≈øt Merchan<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>s of both Nations ≈øay, the more in a place and better, though I confe≈øs it is not ≈øo for Shopkeepers. But for this they may re≈øt ≈øecure, tho≈øe that knovv the cheapne≈øs of living in <hi>England,</hi> in compari≈øon of the≈øe Countries, will
<pb facs="tcp:56430:25"/>abundantly ≈øatisfie them that fear this. Yea I ≈øhall ≈øhew hereafter that the <hi>Engli≈øh</hi> would have more rea≈øon to fear, that we ≈øhould come thither, and deprive them of their Trades. Yet to ≈øay the truth, I ≈øee not that either need fear, were we under the <hi>Engli≈øh,</hi> that either Nation ≈øhould ≈øuffer hereby; ≈øeeing all have had freedom that will to remove formerly, and that hath made ≈øo ≈ømall an alteration as to the ballance of Trade, that it is incon≈øiderable. For if I make my calculation right, there is not much difference, of the <hi>Engli≈øh</hi> here, and the <hi>Dutch</hi> in <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Others argue we are Corrivals for Trade, that is the Mi≈øtre≈øs we both Court, and therefore one mu≈øt marry it.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Seeing then we are in as much danger, that I ≈øay not more, to lo≈øe that part of Trade we have, as to gain more by our conte≈øting; I hope all rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal men will grant it our Intere≈øt, that <hi>England</hi> and we ≈øo compound for it, that each of us may have what <hi>Gods</hi> ble≈ø≈øing, and ju≈øtice, and equity gives to eithers indu≈øtry. And this I am ≈øure was the wi≈ødom of former times. I have ≈øhown it already in part on our ≈øide, and could much more largely both for us and the <hi>Engli≈øh.</hi> In Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> time we were not grown up to our pre≈øent greatne≈øs. In King <hi>James</hi>'s time, who all the world knows was no Martial man, but in his temper as well as <hi>motto</hi> truly paci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick, the Cautionary Towns that <hi>England</hi> po≈ø≈øe≈øt in the≈øe Countries, were A. 1616. ran≈øomed, and we grew up to that greatne≈øs of being an equal match for them in power at Sea. And this the <hi>Engli≈øh</hi> account the great error of Political Intere≈øt; although they mu≈øt needs acknowledge it but fair and hone≈øt dealing. King <hi>Charles</hi> the Fir≈øt, that Prince of ble≈ø≈øed and immortal memory, ≈øeeing how he grew up, not only kept a fair cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re≈øpondency with us, but having experience how cro≈øs Parliaments were to the Court, ≈øo that no<hi rend="sup">o</hi> War could be carried on, did by a fair corre≈øpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence keep friend≈øhip with us; and not only ≈øo, but married his elde≈øt Daughter to the <hi>Prince of Orange</hi> for this rea≈øon of State among≈øt others. For being jealous of this Common-wealth's favouring that party in his Kingdoms, which was then called by the Court <hi>Puritans,</hi> and ≈øeeing the growing greatne≈øs of this State by Sea, did for the≈øe two rea≈øons of State, engage the Prince and this Common-wealth by that Marriage. And this was al≈øo the rea≈øon of State in <hi>Oliver</hi>'s time when Peace was made, that we mu≈øt
<pb facs="tcp:56430:25"/>accord for our mutal Trade. How it hath been ≈øince we all know, and therefore I need not mention it. And this is the fir≈øt weapon our enimies u≈øe, which you ≈øee if we mea≈øure rightly, is too ≈øhort to touch, much le≈øs mortally to wound, the truth of that cau≈øe that we maintain.</p>
               <p>Yet we mu≈øt do our Adver≈øaries right: the wi≈øer ≈øort of them upon the ≈øuppo≈øal of equal powers, (as we have formerly been, and which is that I have hitherto ≈øpoke of) are for peace, and judge it the Intere≈øt of both Nations; but they think our coming under <hi>France</hi> will render <hi>England</hi> ≈øo unequal and inferior a match for us, that we cannot in all humane appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance mi≈øs of marrying our beloved Lady <hi>Trade,</hi> and clearly carrying her from our Corrival. And I confe≈øs ingenou≈øly if there be any thing of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to be ≈øaid for <hi>France,</hi> 'tis this.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Therefore our Adver≈øaries are for <hi>France,</hi> becau≈øe thereby we ≈øhould be able to beat <hi>England</hi> out of their Trade, and ≈øo become ma≈øters of the whole, or the greate≈øt part at lea≈øt of the Sea negotiation.</p>
               <p>Now becau≈øe they ≈øo much triumph in this, though before the victory; we will examin it thorowly, and ≈øee what probability there is of obtaining the greate≈øt part of Trade by this means.</p>
               <p n="1">1. We grant that <hi>England</hi> and this <hi>Republick</hi> being about an equal match at Sea; the acce≈ø≈øion of <hi>France</hi> would clearly make us an overmatch for <hi>England,</hi> if all was true which they ≈øuppo≈øe.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But therein is their mi≈øtake, that they take the≈øe two things for grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, which are both fal≈øe. Fir≈øt that the≈øe Maritime Provinces ≈øhould entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly become <hi>French.</hi> And ≈øecondly that all other Nations will ≈øtand neutral; ≈øo that we ≈øhall have no more to do, but <hi>France</hi> and we entirely to deal with <hi>England</hi> alone.</p>
               <p>Now how far this is from truth, we ≈øhall make abundantly apparent, and by ballancing of powers how little probability there is, of the≈øe their de≈øignes becoming practicable, and ≈øuch as will effect their de≈øires.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Hereby they ≈øuppo≈øe a War, and ≈øuch a long and tedious one, as perhaps we may not live to ≈øee ended. For we cannot rationally imagine the <hi>Engli≈øh</hi> ≈øuch tame <hi>animals,</hi> that they will ea≈øily part with their Trade: but mu≈øt ≈øuppo≈øe they will ≈øet all at ≈øtake, before that jewel of the Land be lo≈øt. Now let us but calmly con≈øider, how de≈øtructive ≈øuch a War will be to our Trade, and what advantages they have above us of ≈øub≈øi≈øting un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a long War, ≈øome of which we have before mentioned; and I do believe no wi≈øe man will think this our Intere≈øt, except there was a greater likeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of a ≈øudden ≈øubduing them, then is rationally to be ex≈øpected, as we ≈øhall pre≈øently make apparent. Now on the contraty, if we come under <hi>England,</hi> there is no fear of a War with <hi>France</hi> at Sea; that Kingdom being ≈øo much inferior in maritime power to either of us, and much more to both. And ≈øhould we have a Land-war with <hi>France,</hi> yet that is more eligible for us than one by Sea, in the opinion of all wi≈øe men, as we have formerly ≈øhown, and ≈øhall have occa≈øion hereafter more fully.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:56430:26"/>
               <p n="2">2. A War with <hi>England</hi> being ≈øuppo≈øed, as it mu≈øt, (for we mu≈øt either ≈øay we can and will have the Trade alone or the greate≈øt part thereof <hi>invitis Anglis,</hi> or we ≈øay nothing to the purpo≈øe) the readie≈øt way to ≈øee what pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability there is for conquering them, and con≈øequently carrying the Trade; will be fir≈øt by ballancing of powers, and then by ≈øome other Con≈øiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. The former of the≈øe we ≈øhall do with re≈øpect to <hi>Zeeland,</hi> and then with re≈øpect to other Nations.</p>
               <p>For the fir≈øt it mu≈øt be con≈øidered that <hi>Zeeland</hi> hath expre≈øly decare <hi>that they will not come under France, but that if they cannot defend them≈øelves, they will then ≈øubmit to England.</hi> It is true (as I have ≈øaid) it is the intere≈øt of the≈øe maritime Provinces to keep their League; but if their enemies Sword cuts it a≈ø≈øunder, and they will not venture the lo≈øs of their Religion and Liberty under <hi>France,</hi> who ≈øhall hinder them? They are free ≈øurely to di≈øpo≈øe of them≈øelves as well as <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>trecht,</hi> or the other Provinces. For in coordinate Powers, when their confederacy is broken, either by them≈øelves or their enimies; each are at liberty, and in their former freedom, to di≈øpo≈øe of them≈øelves, as they ≈øhall think fit. And though <hi>Free≈øland</hi> hath not declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ≈øo that if they ≈øhould come to the utmo≈øt extremity, we know not but they might happily incline to <hi>England</hi> al≈øo; yet becau≈øe that is uncertain, we will be liberal in granting our Adver≈øaries even that which they cannot prove, and take to our ≈øelves only that we can, and ≈øo proceed upon infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible grounds.</p>
               <p>Nor let any one here ≈øtop me, and ≈øay that in taking it for granted that <hi>Zeeland</hi> will be <hi>Engli≈øh,</hi> I may be mi≈øtaken, for they may beat off their enemies and defend them≈øelves. I grant it, although by the way let me ≈øay it, I ≈øee but little likelihood of that; for of above 100 Companies they pay, there is as yet not one in their principalle≈øt Ilands (though how it comes ≈øo, becomes not me to enquire) but the thing is to me matter of admiration. But I will ≈øhew you how I rea≈øon; not from the War, that <hi>England</hi> will conquer <hi>Zeeland,</hi> nor from the Agreement betwixt the two Crownes, which yet is generally ≈øaid brings us under that: but upon ≈øup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øal that we are tired out with the War, and come to treat with our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies (for I hope no man is ≈øo mad, as to think the≈øe Provinces will as <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>trecht,</hi> call them in, and after make what tearms we can get, but treat with them with our weapons in our hands) <hi>Zeelands</hi> not only <hi>Declaration,</hi> but <hi>Inclination</hi> carries them for <hi>England.</hi> So that which way ≈øoever we take conque≈øt by our enemies, their di≈øpo≈øing of us, or our own di≈øpo≈øal of our ≈øelves, <hi>Zeeland</hi> is ≈øtill <hi>Engli≈øh.</hi> So that upon the ≈øuppo≈øition of inabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity to defend our ≈øelves, we are morally certain, that <hi>Zeeland</hi> will fall to <hi>England:</hi> and our Adver≈øaries uncertain, that <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Frie≈øland</hi> will choo≈øe <hi>France.</hi> But we will grant them all they can rea≈øonably de≈øire, <hi>viz.</hi> that the≈øe two Provinces make ≈øuch a choice, and thereupon proceed to the ballancing of Powers.</p>
               <p>Now in Naval ≈øtrength, <hi>Zeeland</hi> hath the proportion of a ≈øixt part in
<pb facs="tcp:56430:26"/>this Republick; there being 5 Admiralities, wherein <hi>Am≈øterdam</hi> hath a double rate, we will ≈øuppo≈øe any number for a Fleet greater or le≈øs to be ≈øet out by them. For example, the States equip a Fleet of 72 Sail herein.</p>

               <p>Although I know in the <hi>quota</hi> or Tax to the Publick, <hi>Frie≈øland</hi> is more: but that is becau≈øe of their greater ≈øhare in the Land, which is a certain revenue, and Trade only a contingency. In ≈øtrength then at Sea we ≈øee, that <hi>Zeeland,</hi> at le≈øt ballances <hi>Frie≈øland</hi> if not more, ≈øhould that Province prove <hi>French,</hi> and this is ≈øufficient for my pre≈øent purpo≈øe.</p>
               <p>Now let us look abroad, and we ≈øhall as clearly find, that <hi>Spain</hi> comes into the <hi>Engli≈øh</hi> ≈øeale. For which way ≈øoever <hi>France</hi> take, <hi>Spain</hi> mu≈øt take the contrary. Nay in this ca≈øe, <hi>Spain</hi> is as much concerned as <hi>England.</hi> For if <hi>France</hi> have the≈øe Provinces entirely, how ≈øhall they alone be able to bring home their <hi>American</hi> Trea≈øure? They know to their ≈øorrow, what they have lo≈øt formerly by the <hi>Dutch</hi> taking their Plate-fleets; and what an extraordinary charge and hazard they had to defend them. And ≈øhall we not then think, that they will rather venture to the utmo≈øt with the <hi>Engli≈øh;</hi> than let us intercept their Trea≈øure, and after ≈øome years be ma≈øter of their Mines? It is true, if I was led as the world is u≈øually, to judge by news, which hath been for ≈øome months that <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>England</hi> are breaking, all this was frivolous; but I make my mea≈øures from rea≈øons of State, which tells me, that they will not, becau≈øe they mu≈øt not, and they mu≈øt not, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe it is their mutual Intere≈øt, and it is their Intere≈øt, becau≈øe otherwi≈øe they cannot ballance <hi>France,</hi> but will both in time be ruined. So then you ≈øee clearly, that upon ≈øuppo≈øition that <hi>Holland</hi> be <hi>French,</hi> it will be <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi> again≈øt <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> and ≈øo we are again ballanced.</p>
               <p>We are thus far upon ≈øure grounds, we ≈øhall now proceed to that which is not much le≈øs certain, if we rightly con≈øider. And that is, that <hi>Denmark</hi> in all probability will become al≈øo our Enemies, if we take <hi>France</hi> ≈øo far for our Friends, as to make him our Ma≈øter. Let us but well ob≈øerve a few fundamental <hi>Maxims of State,</hi> which every Nation according to their Intere≈øt frame for their Government, and it will much help us to make a
<pb facs="tcp:56430:27"/>right judgment in all ≈øuch ca≈øes. Now this is one of that Kingdoms, <hi>Not to ≈øuffer any one to be ab≈øolute Soveraign of Trade and Navigation if they can po≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øibly prevent it.</hi> For the revenues of that Crown mo≈øtly con≈øi≈øting of toll in the <hi>Sound;</hi> we cannot imagine the <hi>Danes</hi> ≈øuch dullards, but they know who ever is ≈øo, will ≈øoon open that pa≈ø≈øage, and make it as free as the water it ≈øelf between the <hi>North and Baltick Seas.</hi> And then the King may ≈øit in's hou≈øe at <hi>Gluckstadt,</hi> and take toll of Boats that pa≈øs in the <hi>Elve;</hi> in≈øtead of <hi>Copenhagen,</hi> and his Ca≈øtle of <hi>Croneberg,</hi> where now he takes toll of all ≈øhips in the <hi>Sound.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I fore≈øee it will be ≈øaid, that <hi>Sweden</hi> will ballance <hi>Denmark,</hi> if that ≈øhould be ≈øo. But ≈øee then what work this <hi>Trade</hi> will make in the world. And this is wholly uncertain: nay, Intere≈øt will rather incline to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. For though <hi>Sweden</hi> be none of the riche≈øt in Trade, yet have they their ≈øhare to lo≈øe as well as the re≈øt. And the Revenues of that Crown con≈øi≈øting much in Copper, (which hath occa≈øioned their Armies ≈øpoiling all the Mines of that Metal in <hi>Germany,</hi> and where≈øoever they could, on purpo≈øe to enhance their own) they know very well that pains might have been ≈øpared, if Commerce ≈øhould have an ab≈øolute Monarch; and that with all the <hi>Chimi≈øtry</hi> that they can u≈øe, they ≈øhall not be able to extract ≈øilver and gold out of that Mettal, when one only Chapman comes to the market. Be≈øides their <hi>Bremi≈øh</hi> and other Territories on this ≈øide the <hi>Baltick,</hi> will ≈øoon lye a bleeding, they know; if <hi>France</hi>'s Sword comes to wound the Roman Eagle, and his race. It may be ≈øome may ≈øay the <hi>Dane</hi> dares not for fear of lo≈øing that we are indebted to him. But who knows not that it is better to lo≈øe a part, than the whole. And if blows be a way of paying of debts, we may happily have <hi>Portugal</hi> ≈øo to pay us.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Having thus ballance the apparent ≈øtrength of both ≈øides, we ≈øhall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to ≈øome other con≈øiderations, concerning the ≈øame. For it is not enough to con≈øider power ab≈øolutely, but al≈øo the management thereof; for le≈øs powers well managed, are u≈øually prevalent above greater. And herein are many things, which in my judgment, were we an over-match for them, which you ≈øee is not ≈øo, would render our ruining their Naval power, and con≈øequently their Traffick impracticable. As 1. Suppo≈øing we are under <hi>France,</hi> ≈øhall their whole Fleet con≈øtantly be here, and leave the <hi>French</hi> Coa≈øt naked, or ≈øhall they from thence come to joyn with us for our Sea expeditions? If the former, <hi>France</hi> is ≈øubject continually to be mole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øted and diverted from <hi>England;</hi> and if the latter to be intercepted, by rea≈øon of their ≈øituation. 2. Who ≈øhall have the direction of Naval Affairs, is to me very con≈øiderable. Whether the <hi>French</hi> alone, or conjoyntly with the <hi>Dutch;</hi> for that the latter only ≈øhould be intru≈øted, is not to be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined. The former way is liable to mi≈øcarry through unskilfulne≈øs, the latter through jealou≈øies and di≈ø≈øentions. 3. Where ≈øhall Mariners be had for our Fleets? ≈øhall the <hi>French</hi> pre≈øs here as in their own Kingdom? If ≈øo, I fore≈øee, we ≈øhall ≈øoon lo≈øe our Sea-men. Or ≈øhall they only u≈øe
<pb facs="tcp:56430:27"/>Volunteers? Then their number will be ≈ømall, becau≈øe the <hi>French</hi> pay is not great. I might mention other particulars, as the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> Officers di≈øcord. The manner of payments, and from whence, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But the≈øe are enow to ≈øhew us, that which way ≈øoever we look there's nothing but difficulty and danger ≈øtares us in the face.</p>
               <p n="4">4. But we have yet that which is more momentous, and that is the ≈øitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Great <hi>Britain.</hi> For could we knock their men in the head, as ea≈øily as our <hi>Borinne</hi>'s their eggs; and ≈øink their Ships, as if they were ≈øhells; yet we cannot po≈ø≈øibly remove the I≈øland. Which is,
<list>
                     <item>1. Not only nigh unto us, but over again≈øt us, ≈øo that we cannot look out, but we are upon them.</item>
                     <item>2. So ≈øituated, that ≈øhould we bear them and their A≈ø≈øociates, (which is not ea≈øie in equal powers) they can ≈øtill manage a War de≈øtructive to us. And what good will it do any but the envious, to ruipe others, if they be ruined them≈øelves? For with a few Ships in the Chanel, wherein they have Harbours all along, to go in and out at plea≈øure; they will force us continually to ≈øail with great Convoys, or we ≈øhall be forced to fall into their hands. And the like may be ≈øaid of the Northern pa≈ø≈øage by the <hi>Orcades,</hi> where a few Ships will ob≈øtruct our Trade. Now how great a prejudice this is to Traffick, I leave all knowing men to judge. For by this means. No ≈øingle Ships, nor ≈ømall numbers can ≈øail. Re≈øtraint will be laid upon going out but in great Fleets, and with ≈øufficient Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voys.

Whereas <hi>France</hi> being on the Continent, is ≈øubject to inva≈øion from <hi>Spain</hi> on ≈øeveral ≈øides.

               <p n="6">6. <hi>Tangier</hi> in the mouth of the <hi>Streights,</hi> will be no ≈ømall prejudice to our <hi>Mediterranean</hi> Trade.

And here I might adde, <hi>Cadiz,</hi> and all the Coa≈øt of <hi>Spain;</hi> for if we be <hi>French,</hi> no wi≈øe man (I think) will doubt, but we ≈øhall have <hi>Spain</hi> our enemies again.</p>
               <p>And the≈øe things I think are abundantly ≈øufficient to di≈ømount our Adver≈øaries confidence, of carrying away the Trade from <hi>England,</hi> if we ≈øhould come under the power of <hi>France.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Another grand Argument again≈øt us is, that we are more likely to enjoy Peace under <hi>France</hi> than <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb facs="tcp:56430:28"/>
               <p>Peace (I confe≈øs) is an invaluable ble≈ø≈øing. How many and great mi≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries doth it free us from! Blood≈øhed, violence to our Per≈øons and E≈øtates, unquietne≈øs, and almo≈øt all manner of troubles. How many and great mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies doth Peace bring along with it! It is both the mother that bears, and the nur≈øe that brings up all our temporal ble≈ø≈øings. It gives us mercies, the freedom of enjoying them, and ≈øweetens their enjoyment. It contains liberty, plenty, equity, tranquility, plea≈øure, and ≈øafety. So that he was a mad man that ≈øhould not chu≈øe Peace. But I fear our coming under <hi>France,</hi> is neither the way to procure Peace, nor the means to pre≈øerve it. And that we by ≈øo doing, ≈øhall but have <hi>Ixions</hi> fate in the Fable, embrace a cloudy and tempe≈øtuous War, in≈øtead of the fair and beloved <hi>Juno</hi> of Peace.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Let it be con≈øidered; that if we have Peace by Land, we have War by Sea: which is to leap out of the frying-pan into the fire. It is an old and a good political axiom, <hi>Ex duobus malis minus e≈øt eligendum;</hi> Theolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gical it was never, for in Divinity, <hi>Nullum malum e≈øt eligendum.</hi> Now if we rightly mea≈øure our Intere≈øt, we ≈øhall find a Land War much more eligible for us upon many accounts, which I need not here to mention, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ea≈øily imagined by all wi≈øe men. For ≈øhould it be granted, that for the pre≈øent the two Crowns accord and we have Peace: it will either be ≈øuch a one as will ruine us, or cannot be la≈øting to be ≈øure; but in a very few years will nece≈ø≈øarily come to the ballance I have mentioned of <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>England</hi> again≈øt <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Holland.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Let us therefore examine their grounds; that ≈øo we may ≈øee before us, and not run our ≈øelves blindfold into de≈øtruction. Which ≈øo far as I can di≈øcern are the≈øe four. <hi>The power and prevalency of his Arms. His trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øure to maintain them. His nearne≈øs to us. And his Allies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fir≈øt for the <hi>power and prevalency of his Arms.</hi> 1. It is true his numbers are great, both in Arms and in the Kingdom of <hi>France.</hi> The great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages he hath, by the largene≈øs, compactne≈øs, ≈øituation, and ≈øoil of his Dominions; the infinite number of Nobility and Gentry for Cavalry, and the populou≈øne≈øs of his Cities and Provinces for Infantry, which cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citate him above all the Princes of <hi>Europe,</hi> to enlarge his Empire; I well know, and willingly grant.</p>
               <p>But what relates to the Kingdom of <hi>France</hi> concerns not us <hi>Netherlanders</hi> in this ca≈øe further than as to his Arms and power to defend us. Now in my rea≈øon the greater power in the <hi>Soveraign,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Sect. <hi>5.</hi>
                  </note> the le≈øs liberty in the <hi>Subject,</hi> as we have already ≈øhown. So that the more numerous his Armies, and ≈øo much the wor≈øe. Doth not <hi>France</hi> groan under this burden, and ≈øhall we de≈øire to do ≈øo, or help to ea≈øe them by bearing part thereof on our backs? If we be ≈øo kind, I dare engage we may have it all, and a thou≈øand thanks from that Kingdom. Which is ≈øo wearied with it, that above one half of them (if my intelligence greatly deceive me not) would rejoyce to ≈øee it le≈ø≈øened, though it were with ≈øome lo≈øs to the honour of the Nation. But becau≈øe I write not to be known, but to better the world, and with
<pb facs="tcp:56430:28"/>my bucket of water to help to quench the Flames, that threaten de≈øtruction to the Prote≈øtant Intere≈øt; I ≈øhall de≈øire all intelligent per≈øons to enquire of tho≈øe that under≈øtand <hi>France,</hi> or have come lately thence; and then let them con≈øider if their condition be de≈øirable. If a numerous Army lies quartered upon us, ≈øhall we not both be kept under by them, and eaten up of them? And although they be paid in the Kings name, yet mu≈øt not we find our ≈øhare of the money? I never yet read or heard of any wi≈øe people, that de≈øired their Prince ≈øo potent, for fear he ≈øhould oppre≈øs them. A due Mediocrity hath always been counted be≈øt. Let any one read the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Roman</hi> Hi≈øtorians, or any others that are wi≈øely writ: and he ≈øhall find, if he duly ob≈øerve, that the <hi>Princes Potency hath always been the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples jealou≈øie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. It is al≈øo true, that he hath been ≈øucce≈øsful in his Arms again≈øt us, beyond mo≈øt mens imaginations, and perhaps even his own hopes and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations. But if all things be rightly con≈øidered, it is no ≈øuch wonder as the world makes it. Our Wars by Sea; our inte≈øtine Divi≈øions; the cowardi≈øe of ≈øome; the corruption of many; and our multiplicity of Garri≈øons, whereby our Forces were ≈øo parcel'd, that fighting ≈øeverally they were ea≈øily vanqui≈øhed; together wi<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>‚Ä¢‚Ä¢</desc>
                  </gap> ≈øeveral other cau≈øes which concurr'd under the hand of <hi>Divine Ju≈øtice,</hi> makes it no wonderment to wi≈øe and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øiderate men. Nor is it any new thing in the world, but that which hath befallen mo≈øt of the Nations in <hi>Europe,</hi> as all their Hi≈øtories abundantly witne≈øs.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Nor will this evince our defence. For it hath often been experiment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that tho≈øe that have won much in a little time, have lo≈øt it again in le≈øs. How did the ≈øame <hi>French</hi> Nation under <hi>Charles</hi> the 8. over-run mo≈øt part of <hi>Italy</hi> in a little time, and quickly lo≈øt it, as the many Hi≈øtorians of both Nations relate! And in our days, how did the <hi>Swede</hi> like lightning pa≈øs through <hi>Poland;</hi> which was quickly extinct and came to nothing! And ≈øo may this (if it plea≈øe God, and we manage our work wi≈øely) like a thunderclap and ≈øudden fla≈øh of lightning, afright and a≈øtoni≈øh us, more than hurt us, as I ≈øhall ≈øhew hereafter.</p>
               <p n="4">4. If <hi>France</hi> goes on, the world grows ≈øo jealous of their greatne≈øs, that they may po≈ø≈øible have work enough; when their hand is again≈øt every one, and every one again≈øt them; and then where ≈øhall be our peace and defence? It is known by all that know former times, how in the <hi>Roman</hi> Monarchy when they were di≈øtre≈ø≈øed at home, they ≈øtill called their Forces from abroad, and left their conquered Provinces to ≈øhift for them≈øelves, as I might in≈øtance in <hi>Spain, France, England,</hi> and many others both Ea≈øtern and We≈øtern. And indeed it always is thus; ≈øo that ≈øhould <hi>France</hi> be fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len into by <hi>Spain,</hi> or <hi>England,</hi> or the <hi>Empire,</hi> or <hi>Italy,</hi> or other ≈øeveral of the≈øe joyntly, or ≈øhould they fall into Civil Wars, which are more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent there than any, yea I think I may ≈øay all the Kingdoms in <hi>Europe;</hi> in what condition ≈øhould we then be? Truly I will tell you, I think fighting
<pb facs="tcp:56430:29"/>with the <hi>French,</hi> and more eager to be rid of them, then many are now to receive them. If any one ≈øay, but would you have us entertain the <hi>Engli≈øh?</hi> I ≈øay no, but pre≈øerve our own freedom by complying with them as I ≈øhall ≈øhew hereafter.</p>
               <p n="5">5. If we will e≈øpou≈øe all the quarrels of <hi>France</hi> we may po≈ø≈øibly have more than enow; and ≈øuch as may prove our ruin, rather than ≈øafety and ≈øecurity. Our Marriners have their Wars by Sea, our citizens and Souldiers by Land. Our Merchants Trade to pay their money, and all to rai≈øe <hi>France</hi> to the univer≈øal <hi>Monarchy,</hi> to the ruin of the Reformed Religion, and al≈øo the greate≈øt part of Chri≈øtendom. And though now his friends be many, yet if he once comes to receive a check his enemies will be more.</p>
               <p n="6">6. I ≈øee no need we have to fear all his power and prevalency, if we will do our duty, and quit our ≈øelves as men for our Country. And if we do, upon our friend≈øhip with the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> we may have Souldiers enow out of tho≈øe 3 Kingdoms, which are as good Infantry ≈øurely as <hi>French,</hi> by their own <hi>Hi≈øtorians</hi> Confe≈ø≈øion, and it is <hi>Foot</hi> we want (if any) for the defence of our Garri≈øons. And be≈øides that they are not ≈øo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be remanded, as tho≈øe of <hi>France;</hi> tho≈øe Kingdoms being Ilands, le≈øs liable to inva≈øion, and le≈øs likely to be engaged in foreign, or to be invol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in Dome≈øtick Wars.</p>
               <p>Secondly, for his trea≈øure, it cannot be denied to be very great. But this is rather again≈øt, than for our Adver≈øaries. For <hi>the richer the Soveraign the poorer the ≈øubject.</hi> And I never knew any people yet, that de≈øired to have their Prince ≈øo rich, e≈øpecially when it comes out of their own pockets. I will not meddle with the di≈øpute of the <hi>Greeks O≈øtraci≈øme,</hi> nor that of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liticians, whether poverty or riches in the Soveraign be better for the ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. A due mean wi≈øe men have allways accounted be≈øt. When neither the Prince may be jealous of his people for their <hi>Riches,</hi> nor they of him for his <hi>Trea≈øures;</hi> but that they may mutually depend on each other, for the good of the whole. For as it is difficult to determin, what the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtrate may not demand, in ca≈øe of nece≈ø≈øity; ≈øo is it ea≈øie to conclude, that he ought not to impoveri≈øh his people when there is none, and make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelf rich by their ruins. That being tollerable, but this intollerable op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈ø≈øion.</p>
               <p>Nor is it imaginable, that he will make <hi>France</hi> poor, to make us rich. Nor is it credible that if they remain poor, we ≈øhall remain rich. For in all Princes there remain ≈øome jealou≈øies of a conquered people, that they may, upon ≈øome revolution of affaires or other, revolt. And therefore it is their u≈øual practice, by all ways po≈ø≈øible to drain them, and draw their riches home; as the <hi>Romans</hi> into <hi>Italy,</hi> and other Conquerors their own Kingdoms; either by bringing it into their own Trea≈øuries, or Native ≈øubjects pur≈øes, or rather both, that ≈øo they may command it upon all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca≈øions.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, for their nearne≈øs unto us, we know it too well. And if the
<pb facs="tcp:56430:29"/>≈øubdued Provinces remain in their hands, ≈øhall find what it is to have ≈øuch neighbors. But otherwi≈øe <hi>England</hi> is nearer us than <hi>France,</hi> and can ea≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier come to our a≈ø≈øi≈øtance. For the <hi>French</hi> have not only a long march, but through part of the Empire, which is their enemie, and ≈øo liable to ob≈øtruction. As to the Prince of <hi>Liege</hi> (or Archbi≈øhop of <hi>Colen</hi>) <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Newburg</hi> and others that have permitted this pa≈ø≈øage, they may pay dear enough for it hereafter; as their ≈øubjects, are paying for it at pre≈øent, even to the <hi>French</hi> them≈øelves. Who are ≈øo weary of their Company, that I per≈øwade my ≈øelf, they will be the fir≈øt that will endeavour, to drive them out, when they ≈øhall find an opportunity.</p>
               <p>But we are not affraid of all our Adver≈øaries weapons, and therefore will enforce their Argument, by ≈øuppo≈øing all they can de≈øire; That <hi>France</hi> will keep the≈øe conquered Provinces, and in all probability make new acque≈øts, by ≈øubduing of the <hi>Spani≈øh Netherlands.</hi> So that if we be not ≈øubject to him, we ≈øhall never be at quiet, but they will continually be as Thorns in our ≈øides.</p>
               <p n="1">1. And why may we not as well ≈øuppo≈øe, that if we be under him, we ≈øhall never be at re≈øt for others? For no Potentate in Chri≈øtendom hath more jealous eyes upon him, nor likelier to be continually imployed in Wars. Now what will changing help us, if we better not our condition? For we may ea≈øily fore≈øee, that if we come under <hi>France,</hi> we ≈øhall have <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi> again≈øt us by Sea (as we have ≈øaid) and the <hi>Germans</hi> and <hi>Spani≈øh</hi> Provinces by Land, and ≈øo ≈øhall be in the ≈øame condition, though not by the ≈øame enemies, that we are now; ground like Corn betwixt the Mil-≈øtones. Yea it is more than probable, that knowing the tickli≈øh con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition and mutinous temper of the <hi>French</hi> Nation, he will bring his Wars into the≈øe Countries and their con≈øines, and ≈øo we ≈øhall again become, the Cock-pit of War for all <hi>Europe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. I doubt not but he will attacque the <hi>Spani≈øh</hi> Provinces and ≈øeek to connect them with his conque≈øts, and then incorporate all with <hi>France.</hi> But it is uncertain what time this may require before they be all under his power. We know not the Articles between the two Crowns, nor are we ≈øure that <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Au≈øtria</hi> will ≈øee this work. Many things may fall out, which no mans eye can fore≈øee. The King of <hi>France</hi> is mortal and may die, and the <hi>Dauphin</hi> young and ≈øo uncapable to carry on ≈øuch mighty de≈øigns. Or he may meet with a check in his enterpri≈øes, and be ≈øtopt in his further progre≈øs of glory. <hi>France</hi> is harra≈øt, and weary of Wars, may fall to their former mutinies. The King of <hi>Spain</hi> may grow more potent. <hi>England, Sweden</hi> and the <hi>Cantons</hi> of <hi>Switzerland</hi> may think them≈øelves con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, as well as the <hi>Empire</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> to ≈øtop the growing greatne≈øs of <hi>France.</hi> The <hi>Spani≈øh</hi> may divert him in <hi>Catalonia</hi> and el≈øe where. Sickne≈øs and mortallity may ≈øeize upon his Armies. Factions in his court, di≈øcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents in the Country, tumults in his Kingdom, and many other Accidents may happen, to call him off us, or at lea≈øt nece≈ø≈øitate him to give us rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øonable
<pb facs="tcp:56430:30"/>conditions, and confine him to his own Kingdom. So that 'tis madne≈øs to avoid a pre≈øent mi≈øchief, to run our ≈øelves upon certain ruine.</p>
               <p n="3">3. If we had the friend≈øhip of <hi>England,</hi> we might ≈øoon be in a capacity to defend our ≈øelves again≈øt <hi>France,</hi> and need not fear the power of their Arms. I do not ≈øay that we alone are able to recover at pre≈øent what we have lo≈øt, without the a≈ø≈øi≈øtance of others: But that the≈øe remaining Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces are able to defend them≈øelves, and either let go the other, or in time po≈ø≈øibly regain them, as we ≈øhall ≈øhew hereafter.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, For his <hi>Allies,</hi> they need not fright us. For all friend≈øhip of the World, and e≈øpecially publick, proves often times like winter brooks, which run freely when we have lea≈øt need of them, but fail us in drought when we want their Water. If the fortunes of <hi>France</hi> ≈øhould once decline, we ≈øhould ≈øee tho≈øe that now adore them, readily renounce this their idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and not only confe≈øs their former fault, but help to turn the <hi>Wheel</hi> about, and bring them under whom they now exalt.</p>
               <p>And thus we ≈øee what ≈ømall grounds there are of enjoying ≈øuch great Peace under <hi>France,</hi> as our Adver≈øaries flatter them≈øelves withal, and would per≈øwade the World of; which will never find credit with wi≈øe men, who are u≈øed to judge by Rea≈øons of State, and not by the vain ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments of fancy.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The fourth argument for <hi>France</hi> is, their having the <hi>upper Provinces</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, which are of ≈øuch concernment to the <hi>Nether,</hi> that they affirm we cannot want them, and therefore we mu≈øt call in <hi>France</hi> that he may have them all, that ≈øo they may be joyned under one <hi>Head.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We cannot want them ≈øay they.

               <p>Let us therefore examine the≈øe things, and having ≈øo done, we ≈øhall give a relea≈øe to your patience in this great Argument of our Adver≈øaries concerning <hi>Trade.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fir≈øt that we cannot want them for our <hi>Security,</hi> is apparently fal≈øe. Nay upon a <hi>Politick account</hi> we had better part with them, though not in point of <hi>Honour</hi> and <hi>Religion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. They were a continual charge to tho≈øe inferior <hi>Provinces,</hi> which yet was willingly born, in regard of their being an out Scon≈øe to us, which many ≈øuppo≈øed ≈øufficiently ≈øtrong for our defence. Which yet others have always doubted of, and now we find they had ≈øufficient rea≈øon. Seeing then ≈øome of them willingly de≈øerted us, and others ≈ølightly defended them≈øelves, and us con≈øequently, and thus laid us open to the inva≈øion of our enemies: if we let them go, and they ≈øuffer thereby, they may thank them≈øelves, and we mu≈øt otherwi≈øe ≈øecure our Country.</p>
               <p n="2">2. I wonder men ≈øhould think they can ≈øecure us, when we ≈øee the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary by our experience. Nay indeed this was the great mi≈øtake that had like to have ruined us all. For we relying on them, was unprepared for our own defence, whereby the whole was greatly endangered. Yea ≈øo
<pb facs="tcp:56430:30"/>greatly, that if the <hi>French</hi> had fallen into <hi>Holland,</hi> when they came to <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>trecht,</hi> I tremble to think, what work they might have made among≈øt us.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It was apparent that the boundaries of the Common-wealth, was too great, and our Garri≈øons too many, to defend again≈øt ≈øuch powerful Armies. Which at the ≈øame time are not only Ma≈øters of the Field, but able to a≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øault what Places they plea≈øe. This War being far different from our form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er with <hi>Spain</hi> (or le≈øs Potentates) wherein we had an Army to ballance theirs, for relief of ≈øuch Garri≈øons as were at any time attackt by them. And this the <hi>Author</hi> of the <hi>Intere≈øt of Holland,</hi> hath long ≈øince well ob≈øerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and experience now ≈øhews us. Wherein I dare be his ≈øecond, again≈øt any combatants that dare encounter him.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Let any man but recount our Garri≈øons with their greatne≈øs, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute what number of men is requi≈øite for their defence; and he will ≈øoon ≈øee, whether I have not clear rea≈øon on my ≈øide. I ≈øhall not now ≈øtand to do that, though if any be ob≈øtinate, I can do it ≈øufficiently to convince him: that though the <hi>States</hi> in times of Peace maintain 60000, and in this War above 100000 men by Land; yet were they not half enow to defend all our Garri≈øons, and keep an Army in the Field to relieve them. And therefore I never expected any better ≈øucce≈øs of the War, than now we ≈øee; though my judgment was entertained by many with merriment, and of others with fears it might prove Prophetical. For we mu≈øt either have di≈ømantled mo≈øt of the weake≈øt, and ≈øupplied a few of mo≈øt con≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence for a ≈øtrong re≈øi≈øtance; or it was never likely it ≈øhould be otherwi≈øe than it is; it being always found true by experience, that <hi>multiplicity of weak powers prove none again≈øt ≈øtrong,</hi> for <hi>dum ≈øinguli pugnant, univer≈øi vincuntur.</hi> And therefore we ≈øee our enemies, had the wi≈ødom to wave <hi>Mae≈øtricht,</hi> that was provided with men to give them work; and fell upon ≈øuch places, as they either knew their money had, or their Swords could mo≈øt ea≈øily conquer.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Many of our outmo≈øt Garri≈øons lying in a champaign Country, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be relieved, without a powerful Army of Cavalry.

               <p n="8">8. If we rightly con≈øider, great Territories are for Kings, ≈ømall only fit for Common-wealths. This we may ob≈øerve in the Hi≈øtories of former times, in the <hi>Grecian</hi> Republicks and their neighbour Kingdoms. For the <hi>Roman</hi> was mixt of <hi>Monarchy</hi> and <hi>Ari≈øtocracy,</hi> by the great power of their <hi>Con≈øuls</hi> ruling as Monarchs by their turns, and e≈øpecially in dangers by <hi>Dictators.</hi> Yea our own experience hath ≈øhown us this in the neighbou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Kingdoms. But what ≈øhall I ≈øay, many men are like the Judges Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues at <hi>Thebes;</hi> have their eyes blinded and hands lamed, though not for Ju≈øtice but for judgment, they can neither ≈øee nor feel before them. In 59 being then in <hi>England,</hi> in ≈øome Gentlemens Company, where there were ≈øome zealous Republicans, and I from Hi≈øtory and ob≈øervation
<pb facs="tcp:56430:31"/>≈øhewing them, that in great Dominions, e≈øpecially, where there are many Nobility, a Common-wealth could never ≈øtand long, that if there, it mu≈øt be from the City of <hi>London</hi> managing it as <hi>Rome</hi> had done, and not as they went to work, and ≈øeveral other things, ≈øhewing the impracticablene≈øs of their notions, (which I have rea≈øon to remember, for I was complained of to <hi>Lambert,</hi> and was in danger of being called before the <hi>Council of State</hi>) In the year 60. ≈øome of them took me for half a Prophet, and ≈øo perhaps may ≈øome hereafter, for what I ≈øhall now ≈øay: <hi>That if we affect great Terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories by Land we ≈øhall lo≈øe all.</hi> It is our Sea affairs, that we are ≈øet for by our Country, made for by our genious, and fit for e≈øpecially, by our im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment. And we may as well think to turn our Rivers, as change the≈øe things, nay, indeed, if we could, it would quickly turn to our de≈øtruction: Traffick by Sea, as I formerly have ≈øhown, being our chief ≈øecular intere≈øt.</p>
               <p>But I fore≈øee what will here be ≈øaid, that a weak defence is better than none, and how all the≈øe <hi>Inferior Provinces</hi> be otherwi≈øe ≈øecured.</p>
               <p>And it is very true indeed, <hi>better a weak wall, than none at all.</hi> And if we could not build a ≈øtronger, and at le≈øs charges, and with far le≈øs co≈øt for repa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration and defence again≈øt the violent ≈øtorms of our Enemies, (for none can ≈øecure us again≈øt Heaven) we ≈øhould be a≈øhamed to have thrown down the old, which (in my judgment) is by the former Con≈øiderations levelled with the ground. For as it is folly to pull down before we con≈øider how to build better, ≈øo we mu≈øt take heed that therein we commit not tho≈øe errors which many wi≈øe men (though that was none of their wi≈ødom) have fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently (as I have often ob≈øerved) fallen into in their building, <hi>To be≈øtow as much in piecing and patching an old hou≈øe, as would build a new one far ≈øtronger and better: and when they have built either old or new, to find ≈øeveral inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encies therein, which a provident fore-≈øight might have prevented.</hi> As the ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Mathematician Dr. <hi>Wren</hi> hath demon≈øtrated (as I hear) in <hi>England,</hi> that they had better build S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s in <hi>London</hi> anew, than repair the old.

But I will briefly touch of ≈øome things, which are ≈øufficient (I think) to ≈øilence mine Adver≈øaries.</p>
               <p>There are 5 or ≈øix ways of Natural Fortification and defence of a Country.</p>
               <p>Seas for I≈ølands, which are the be≈øt. For though they are thereby incapacitated to enlarge their Empire abroad, being by the Sea as it were confined to home, yet have they great advantages thereby, not only of
<pb facs="tcp:56430:32"/>Maritime Negotiation, but al≈øo ≈øecurity from Inva≈øion. So that they are at ≈ømall charges for maintaining Armies; which tho≈øe that live on Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nents, mu≈øt con≈øtantly do for their defence: otherwi≈øe the door ≈øtands open for the fir≈øt that comes, to enter in and take po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion.</p>
               <p>Great Mountains that are unpa≈ø≈øible for Armies, or ≈øuch pa≈ø≈øes as the famous <hi>Thermopyles,</hi> which are ea≈øily defended, and the≈øe are next to Seas the be≈øt defence.</p>
               <p>Va≈øt Wilderne≈ø≈øes where Armies can have no Provi≈øion to march, but what they carry along with them, as in <hi>Africa.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Penin≈øular Countries, which are ea≈øily retrencht within lines of ≈øecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as the famous Wall in the North of <hi>England,</hi> fir≈øt made by <hi>Agricola, Nero</hi>'s General there, repaired by <hi>Hadrian,</hi> and after by <hi>Severus</hi> again≈øt the <hi>Picts,</hi> the ruines whereof are ≈øtill apparent. And <hi>Scotland</hi> often al≈øo again≈øt <hi>England</hi> hath thus retrencht them≈øelves, even in our days with great ≈øafety again≈øt the <hi>Engli≈øh</hi> Army; which if they had had the wi≈ødom to have kept within, they had ≈øaved them≈øelves and the Kingdom: but their adventurous folly in for≈øaking them, was dearly paid for by the lo≈øs of both.</p>
               <p>Great Rivers which cannot ea≈øily be pa≈øt. As <hi>Euphrates</hi> in the <hi>Ea≈øt,</hi> and the <hi>Rhyne</hi> in the <hi>We≈øt,</hi> defended tho≈øe Nations beyond them, from the great power of the <hi>Romans.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And la≈øtly inundations by Water, mari≈øh and boggy grounds, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I might be large in examples of all the≈øe in ≈øeveral Kingdoms of the World; and al≈øo in the wonderful Providence of God, who hereby ≈øets bounds and limits to the mighty <hi>Nimrod</hi>'s of the World, ≈øaying unto them by the voice of Nature as to the great Seas and Waters, <hi>hitherto ≈øhall ye go and no further:</hi> but I will confine my ≈øelf to our own Country.</p>
               <p>Now the≈øe Provinces if we con≈øider them aright, are naturally fortified mo≈øt of the≈øe ways. Not by Mountains, for we live in a level Country; nor by De≈øarts and barren Wilderne≈ø≈øes, for we have a fruitful Land, like <hi>Canaan</hi> flowing with milk and honey. But all the other ways we are defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øible; ≈øo that if we can but defend our ≈øelves by Sea, and keep that for our Commerce; we need not fear all our Enemies by Land. We have the Sea to guard us below, mighty Rivers not only within, but on both ≈øides the≈øe Provinces to defend us: we are either I≈ølands as <hi>Zeeland;</hi> or Penin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øular as <hi>Frie≈øland</hi> and <hi>Groeningen</hi> together, and <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>trecht,</hi> by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon of the Sea and great Rivers that almo≈øt ≈øurround them. And let it come to the utmo≈øt extremity, we can by Water drown our Enemies, and ≈øave our ≈øelves in our Cities. So that they that talk of conquering us, mu≈øt either be fools, or ignorant of the Country: and tho≈øe that fear to be conquered, pu≈øillanimous and frighted with vain bravadoes.</p>
               <p>But we will be a little more particular, in running over brie≈øly the ≈øeveral Provinces.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Zeeland</hi> con≈øi≈øting wholly of I≈ølands, is thereby well fortified, and the
<pb facs="tcp:56430:32"/>Inhabitants ≈øo u≈øed to the Water, that they are not ea≈øily ma≈øtered therein.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Frie≈øland</hi> and <hi>Groningen</hi> together, are almo≈øt ≈øurrounded with the <hi>North</hi> and <hi>South</hi> Seas, together with the River <hi>Emes,</hi> and ≈øcarce acce≈ø≈øible by Land in regard of the mari≈øh or boggy grounds, if <hi>Coeverden</hi> and ≈øome other ≈øtrong places on the pa≈ø≈øes be kept.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Holland</hi> will prove the greate≈øt difficulty, and of mo≈øt con≈øequence; that Province being the Head and Heart of this Republick. For this end I mu≈øt ≈øuppo≈øe that we mu≈øt have part of the Province of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>trecht,</hi> which we mu≈øt either regain by Treaty, or by ≈øtrength, let it co≈øt what it will, both for our communication, and future ≈øafety. And then we have the≈øe two again almo≈øt environed with the <hi>North</hi> and <hi>South Seas</hi> and ≈øeveral branches of the <hi>Rhyme</hi> and <hi>Maes.</hi> Only one neck of ground between the <hi>Leck</hi> and <hi>South Sea</hi> of 5 or 6 miles, where a River might be cut to carry water from the former, as ≈øomething higher, into the latter: from between <hi>Viana</hi> and <hi>Twael,</hi> from whence downwards the River is deep, and hath the Tyde flowing up, by <hi>Houten, Heer, Melis waert, Melaeten,</hi> and ≈øo along the low grounds to <hi>Pynenborch</hi> into the R<gap reason="illegible" extent="4 letters">

                  <hi>Eem</hi> to the <hi>South Sea.</hi> Which will make the whole adjacent Country being low, ≈øtagnate with water, and ≈øo defend the≈øe two Provinces from their enemies incur≈øions. And the re≈øt are done to our hands, by the ≈øeveral foldings of the Arms of tho≈øe two great Rivers, the <hi>Rhyne</hi> and the <hi>Ma≈øe,</hi> who≈øe ≈øeveral denominations I need not mention, nor the places where, the≈øe being ≈øufficiently known to tho≈øe that know the≈øe Countries.</p>
               <p>But oh <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>trecht! <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>trecht!</hi> I fore≈øee there will ≈øo much depend upon that one City, that I fear the greate≈øt Affairs of <hi>Europe</hi> will hang, and turn upon that ≈øingle hinge. I know we flatter our ≈øelves they will part with it, and I wi≈øh we may not be deceived; but I fear far other things, not ≈øo much from what I have ≈øaid, as from other rea≈øons of State. But if any will ask what tho≈øe are: I ≈øay <hi>Ho-la,</hi> I am ≈øo far from publi≈øhing them, that if the ≈øhirt on my back knew the thoughts of my heart herein, it ≈øhould be my fir≈øt work to burn it.</p>
               <p>But our Adver≈øaries will fight it out to the ≈øtumps both of their ≈øtrength and weapons. They ≈øay the <hi>French</hi> in the Superior Provinces hath the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of our <hi>Rivers,</hi> and ≈øo will be able to ruine our <hi>Trade.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Truly I am tired with this long di≈øcour≈øe of Trade, and therefore for a diverti≈øement I will tell you a ≈øhort and plea≈øant ≈øtory.

<pb facs="tcp:56430:33"/>Thames?</hi> The King perceiving it, would needs know what he ≈øaid, and being told, bur≈øt out into laughter, and ≈øwore in his Scotti≈øh dialect he was a <hi>fau≈øe loune,</hi> and packt them away. So let me merrily ask mine Adver≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries one after another, what? will the King of <hi>France</hi> turn the <hi>Rhyne?</hi> will he turn the <hi>Maes?</hi> Will he cut off the arms of tho≈øe mighty Rivers? Or will he riveleti≈øe them into more hundred furrows than Hi≈øtorians tell us <hi>Cyrus</hi> did <hi>Gyndes</hi> when he went to take <hi>Babylon?</hi> Will he cha≈øti≈øe the South Sea, and fetter it, as <hi>Xerxes</hi> did the <hi>Helle≈øpont,</hi> making <hi>Harderwick</hi> and <hi>Hoorne</hi> as <hi>S<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

And except he can, ≈øo long as we keep the mouth of the Rivers where they exonorate them≈øelves into the Sea; let the <hi>French</hi> keep them above, and ≈øee what they can make of them.</p>
               <p>But to be ≈øerious. I had thought our Trading had been in Ships at Sea e≈øpecially, and not with Boats in Rivers. And that it is the≈øe inferior Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces, and our Sea Tra≈ø≈øick that <hi>France</hi> aims at; though in regard of our Naval ≈øtrength, he comes do<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap> upon us by Land; thinking that way to carry the Country. For his <gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>‚Ä¢‚Ä¢</desc>
                  </gap>pping the Boats pa≈ø≈øing up and down the <hi>Rhine</hi> and <hi>Maes,</hi> there is no fear if we rightly con≈øider, that that will ruine the <hi>French</hi> them≈øelves more than us. In regard we can ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øi≈øt without this, and they cannot. We have Corn in abundance from <hi>Dant≈øick</hi> and other places, with which we ≈øupply others in want: but they mu≈øt have theirs from above, by the≈øe Rivers. How can we think that he ≈øhould ≈øtop the Commerce betwixt <hi>Germany</hi> and the≈øe Countries by the <hi>Rhyne;</hi> and they not ≈øtop his Provi≈øions at <hi>Colen</hi> and other places? Or that he intercept the Traffick by the <hi>Maes;</hi> and <hi>Leige,</hi> or at lea≈øt <hi>Namurs</hi> under the <hi>Spani≈øh,</hi> ≈øhould not prohibit his ≈øupplies from <hi>France?</hi> There are two ways of dealing with Enemies. If ≈ømall to beat them, if great to pine them. They dare not but leave a con≈øiderable Army in tho≈øe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces, for fear of the former; and they mu≈øt be ≈øupplied from abroad, for fear of the latter. Now if they be not from us beneath, they mu≈øt be by the≈øe from above; for tho≈øe Provinces alone are not able to provide for them; and why then ≈øhould we trouble our ≈øelves with ≈øuch fanta≈øtical fears? Were it not that I thought the≈øe things ≈øufficient, and that I have been already ≈øo prolix in this Argument; I would ≈øhew at large that tho≈øe above depend on us for our Money and Commodities, more than we on them for theirs. But to do this ≈øatisfactorily, would be a large di≈øcour≈øe, and therefore I di≈ømi≈øs it, at lea≈øt for the pre≈øent.</p>
               <p>Our Adver≈øaries having thus ≈øpent their Cannon upon us ineffectually, will needs try a Volly of ≈ømall ≈øhot: That we mu≈øt have the≈øe out-Provinces, for the quartering our Army, that ≈øo our Cities may be free from their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øturbance in Trade.</p>
               <p>But this reaches us not. For we have out-Garri≈øons enow upon the Con≈øines of the≈øe inferior Provinces, as <hi>Sluys, Bergen op Zoom, Breda,
<pb facs="tcp:56430:33"/>Bu≈øs, &amp;c.</hi> well known, that are of le≈øs Trade, and capable to quarter 100000 men if need was, as I can ea≈øily make apparent. Nor do I imagine Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers prejudicial to any trading City, if they be not too numerous; but rather helpful, by the Exci≈øe they pay, the work when off the watch they cheaply perform, the ≈øpending their money with the poorer ≈øort, and ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral other ways which might be mentioned.</p>
               <p>And thus you ≈øee in point of profit, or worldly Intere≈øt, that we can want the ≈øuperior Provinces, (excepting the City of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>trecht,</hi> and a little of the Circumjacent Country) yea had better quit them upon ≈øeveral accounts; and though our boundaries be le≈øs, yet if we be more compact and ≈øtronger, that will abundantly compen≈øate our greatne≈øs: be≈øides the va≈øt expence which is ≈øpared thereby, not only of blood, but trea≈øure, in maintaining con≈øtantly ≈øo great an Army as we mu≈øt, if we will recover and defend them. The only advantage that I can fore≈øee by them is, to have bad neighbours further off: but whether that will Countervail the co≈øt, may be a que≈øtion to others, but is none to me.</p>
               <p>But if we value our honour at ≈øo high a rate, and will pay ≈øo dear for it, that if the <hi>French</hi> will not part with them upon fair terms, we will wage war for them; I heartily wi≈øh we never repent it. For I have ob≈øerved <hi>that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealths are fitter for ≈øelf defence, and Kingdoms for conque≈øts.</hi> Which is ≈øhaddowed out by the <hi>Venetian</hi> Statue, holding a Shield in the right hand: that ≈øome unskilful Travellers condemn, as an error in the Statuary. Who≈øe yet ambitious ≈øwerving from this Common-wealths maxim, co≈øt them very dear: and ≈øeeing it is the neare≈øt parallel to our ca≈øe I know, I ≈øhall briefly relate it, becau≈øe I think it may be u≈øeful for us. The <hi>Venetians</hi> having long warred with the <hi>Genone≈øe</hi> at Sea, afterwards ca≈øt an ambitious eye on the Continent of <hi>Italy,</hi> and by one means or other (too long to relate) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came Ma≈øters of many con≈øiderable places. This made them envied by their neighbouring Monarchs, who entred at <hi>Cambray</hi> A. 1508. into a league to war again≈øt them. <hi>Maximilian</hi> the Emperor, fir≈øt of that name, recovered <hi>Padua, Vineentia, Verona, &amp;c.</hi> belonging to the Empire: the <hi>Pope Ravenna, Cernia, Ariminum</hi> and <hi>Faventia: Lewis</hi> the 12. then po≈ø≈øe≈øt of <hi>Millain</hi> in right thereof, <hi>Bergamum, Crema, Cremona</hi> and <hi>Brixia: Ferdinand</hi> the King of <hi>Spain</hi> in right of <hi>Naples, Manfredonia, Trano, Barlet</hi> and <hi>Manopoli,</hi> all of them Havens on the <hi>Adriatick:</hi> the Duke of <hi>Ferrara, Rovigo:</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Mantua, A≈øula:</hi> in ≈øo much that the <hi>Venetians</hi> were forced to betake them≈øelves to the <hi>I≈ølands</hi> and Mari≈øhes of their City. And yet in a ≈øhort time by compliance with the <hi>Pope,</hi> they broke the confederacy, and by one means or other regained the re≈øt, except tho≈øe belonging to the Realm of <hi>Naples.</hi> The que≈øtion is debated in the Senate, <hi>whether they ≈øhould war for the≈øe or no?</hi> And wi≈øely concluded in the negative, <hi>That although they were commodious Havens for them, yet better to part with them, than war with ≈øuch a potent Prince as Spain.</hi> And let me ≈øay it freely of our ≈øelves, that had we ≈øerved God, followed our Trade, and kept our ≈øelves
<pb facs="tcp:56430:34"/>more off the Stage of <hi>Honour,</hi> as our Ance≈øtors did: We had le≈øs occa≈øioned our neighbours envy, and not been reduced to tho≈øe Strates we are in.</p>
               <p>But if our Senators be of <hi>Na≈øica</hi>'s judgement, and would have this foil for our <hi>Martial valour,</hi> and this exerci≈øe to rub of the ru≈øt, our Arms have contracted by their long re≈øt. If our Cavalry are ambitious to have the Trumpet of Fame ≈øound their prai≈øes, and the Infantry to have their marches beaten, through ≈øucceeding Ages and Generations. I wi≈øh that the eccho of Fame may follow them, with a clearer ≈øound than the hoar≈øe clamour of the People; and hope that the imbellick Bores that are ready to ≈øtart at the report of a Gun, and ≈øtoop at the whi≈øtling of a Bullet, may, by having dangers familiarized to them, become (as the Fox did with the Lion) undaunted at la≈øt, and under their brave General and Commanders regain our reputation; and ≈øhall heartily pray both for our Senators pro≈øpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and Souldiers ≈øucce≈øs.</p>
               <p>The only con≈øideration that ≈øways with me for conte≈øting for them, if we cannot have them otherwi≈øe, is that of <hi>Religion.</hi> If therefore this po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy, I have pleaded ≈øhould prove Apocryphal; and that our League and Alliance with them, obliges us for them recovery; or that the rules of Chri≈øtian Charity require us, to adventure our own lo≈øs for their ≈øafety: God forbid that I, or a any man el≈øe ≈øhould be again≈øt it; and I hope there are none ≈øo degenerate, but will contribute their be≈øt a≈ø≈øi≈øtance both in pur≈øe and per≈øon to ≈øo good a work. If the <hi>Turks</hi> will redeem the caged birds to ≈øet them at liberty, let us much more willingly our Chri≈øtian Brethren, and ≈øo committing our cau≈øe to God, pa≈øs thorow the <hi>Temple of Vertue,</hi> that we may happily come to that of <hi>Honour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Having thus ≈øhewn the impregnablene≈øs of the truth of our cau≈øe, again≈øt the a≈ø≈øaults of its Adver≈øaries; and fought it out with them, in their repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øenting the <hi>Advantages of being under France, and di≈øadvantages of being under England,</hi> and our Replying: It comes now to our turn to be <hi>A≈ø≈øailants,</hi> wherein we hope to obtain an ab≈øolute conque≈øt, by ≈øhewing them the quite contrary.</p>
               <p>Now herein we might be very large, if we would argue from all the <hi>≈øua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øory</hi> and <hi>di≈ø≈øua≈øory topicks;</hi> as the <hi>Hone≈øty</hi> of being under <hi>England</hi> rather than <hi>France</hi> for the common Intere≈øt of the Prote≈øtant Religion; the <hi>Hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rablene≈øs</hi> thereof for the common good of Chri≈øtendom, who≈øe Intere≈øt it is to oppo≈øe the greatne≈øs of <hi>France,</hi> as we ≈øhall ≈øhew hereafter: the <hi>Equity</hi> of this for a≈ø≈øi≈øting our <hi>Allies</hi> again≈øt <hi>France:</hi> the <hi>po≈ø≈øibility</hi> or practicable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs of this only, now that his <hi>Highne≈øs</hi> is both <hi>General</hi> and <hi>Stadt-holder:</hi> and al≈øo from the contrary of the≈øe if we ≈øeek to come under <hi>France.</hi> But we ≈øhall only in≈øi≈øt upon that of <hi>

                  </head>
                  <p n="1">1. Our being under <hi>France</hi> brings us infallibly unto a War with <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> in ≈øome ≈øhort time at lea≈øt, if not pre≈øently, as we have already ≈øhown. Now how de≈øtructive ≈øuch a War is to our maritime Negotiation, I leave all wi≈øe men to judge, and Merchants e≈øpcially who have the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience thereof.</p>
                  <p>Whereas on the contrary our being under <hi>England,</hi> gives us <hi>Peace</hi> and freedom of Trade <hi>by Sea;</hi> at lea≈øt incon≈øiderable di≈øturbance in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon; yea very probably by <hi>Land</hi> al≈øo; in regard we can ≈øpoil <hi>France</hi>'s Trade, di≈øturb his coa≈øts, divert his de≈øigns, and ballacne his power. For <hi>France</hi> cannot fight with all Europe. If we be under <hi>England,</hi> we have <hi>Spain,</hi> the Empire &amp;c. with us: and if <hi>France</hi> will fight, we need not fear him. But if that which is ≈øaid be not ≈øufficient (as I ≈øuppo≈øe it is) I am ready to make it apparent, that a Land War is more eligible for this Republick, then one by Sea with ≈øuch potent enemies, and take the utmo≈øt interruption <hi>France</hi> can make of our Sea-traffick into the ballance.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. If we come under <hi>France</hi> we ≈øhall either do it <hi>entirely,</hi> or <hi>partially.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If the former we are ruined in a great mea≈øure in our Commerce, for ≈øup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øing that the <hi>Spani≈øh Netherlands</hi> fall under <hi>France</hi> al≈øo, as in all proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility they will, and that ≈øpeedily, as even our Adver≈øaries them≈øelves take it for granted; the <hi>Scheld</hi> will be open and free, and ≈øo <hi>Antwerp, Bruxels, Mechlin, Loven, Lier</hi> and the other Cities of <hi>Brabant,</hi> by this means recover part of their former Commerce; which now we deprive them of by <hi>Vli≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øing</hi> and <hi>Rammekens</hi> below, and <hi>Lillo</hi> above on that River: and <hi>Ghant, Cortrick, Rii≈ø≈øel</hi> and other Cities of <hi>Flanders</hi> a part, by the former River being free, and by opening the other pa≈ø≈øage to them, which is now ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtructed at the <hi>Sas van Ghant.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now of how great con≈øequence this is to us, e≈øpecially in regard of <hi>Am≈øterdam,</hi> which bears now a double proportion in the Admiralties, and almo≈øt the half of the burden of the Taxes of <hi>Holland,</hi> which is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo≈øt the half of the whole Republick, I leave any one to judge, and e≈øpecially tho≈øe that know the principles of intere≈øt for that great and flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri≈øhing City. I could be very large upon this, in ≈øhewing how the fall of <hi>Antwerp</hi> was the ri≈øe of <hi>Am≈øterdam;</hi> how this City prevailed that the other ≈øhould not be taken by the Arms of this Republick; as al≈øo what ≈øome ≈øay it co≈øt them to prevent it; that this was a great inducement to the States, not to enlarge the Republick on the ≈øide of <hi>Flanders</hi> and <hi>Brabant;</hi> and what a great motive it was to make peace with <hi>Spain,</hi> that ≈øo they might prevent ≈øo Potent a Prince as <hi>France,</hi> from coming ≈øo nigh them upon that quarter, and doing it by power, and how <hi>Holland</hi> gave ≈øecurity for maintaining the peace, when <hi>Zeeland</hi> prote≈øted again≈øt the ≈øame: But the≈øe are ≈øo well known in <hi>Holland,</hi> and the objections again≈øt it ≈øo an≈øwered,<note place="margin">Schookius de Pace.</note>, that I need not lanch into this <hi>Ocean.</hi> Now who is ≈øo purblind but he may

Yea let me ≈øay it, for I know it to be true, this is that the Trading <hi>Flamens</hi> long for, ≈øeek for, and ≈øhould above all things be glad to ≈øee: ≈øo that in ≈øtead of hindring, they ≈øhall help, all they dare, <hi>Frances</hi> conque≈øt for this their Intere≈øt.</p>

Or let it be ≈øuppo≈øed that there is frend≈øhip between <hi>France</hi> and <hi>England</hi> in the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their ≈øeveral ≈øhares (for we will grant all po≈ø≈øibilities, and much more probabilities, our Adver≈øaries can rea≈øonably de≈øire) and how will our mutual traffick be ≈øpoiled, by the impo≈øitions of both Crowns upon commodities; if we ≈øhould pay to the one in <hi>Holland</hi> and the other in <hi>Zee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> as undoubtedly we mu≈øt.

                  <p>Whereas on the contrary were we either of the≈øe ways under <hi>England,</hi> we exclude <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Flanders,</hi> and pre≈øerve our Trade to our ≈øelves.</p>
                  <p>If we be entirely under <hi>England;</hi> we may ≈øave the <hi>Spani≈øh</hi> Netherlands, who≈øe Governors are contented with what Commerce they have, rather than lo≈øe all; we may pre≈øerve our ≈øelves from the <hi>French</hi> neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood;
<pb facs="tcp:56430:35"/>and thereby al≈øo our Trade from them both.</p>
                  <p>Or if we be but in part ≈øo; we pre≈øerve the friend≈øhip of the≈øe Provinces, the Trade betwixt us, ≈øecure our intere≈øt both at home and abroad, and command the Commerce of <hi>Europe</hi> at our plea≈øure.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. If we come under <hi>France,</hi> we have not only <hi>Spain</hi> our Enemy by Sea and Land (as we have ≈øhewn) but the lo≈øs of our <hi>Spani≈øh Trade,</hi> and the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarding of our whole <hi>Levant Traffick:</hi> And if we rightly calculate, that amounts to no ≈ømall part of our Commerce.

                  </p>
                  <p>Whereas on the contrary, if we come under <hi>England;</hi> we certainly ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure our Commerce with <hi>Spain,</hi> and all the <hi>Territories</hi> belonging to that <hi>Crown.</hi> And not only ≈øo, but again≈øt the <hi>Turki≈øh Pyrates</hi> which infe≈øt tho≈øe Seas, which would be of no ≈ømall advantage to us.

Have they not for this end erected a <hi>Company?</hi> And now got footing there, and follow it further, even in this la≈øt year, as we hear, with their greate≈øt endeavours? Nay, is not this the principal motive, which induces them to make this War? I know we need not fear them there, nor all <hi>Europe</hi> if we have peace here, and can ≈øend them ≈øupplies; We are ≈øo far advanced in that Negotiation;
<pb facs="tcp:56430:36"/>≈øo ≈øtrong in Forts, Shipping and Souldiers; our men ≈øo accu≈øtomed to the heat of tho≈øe Countries; our Mariners to tho≈øe Coa≈øts; and Merchants to the Languages and Trade of tho≈øe parts. But if we come under <hi>France,</hi> will not <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi> ≈øeek continually to intercep our ≈øupplies thither, and our Returns from thence? Will not this put us to va≈øt Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of Convoys to defend our Ships going and coming in ≈øecurity? Will not ≈øome through ≈øtorms and other accidents when ≈øeparated, unavoida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly fall into their hands, as we have often experienced? And will they not always be in one hazard or other from them for ≈øafety? Yea let us ≈øuppo≈øe that all ≈øtands well there, and none of our Ships mi≈øcarry through our Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, but ≈øafely Arrive both there and here; where ≈øhall we vent tho≈øe Commodities from thence at the prices they now yield us; when we have ≈øuch Enemies at home, and ≈øuch dangers in carrying them abroad, as we have formerly ≈øhown? Nay, can we rationally think otherwi≈øe, than that the Kingdom of <hi>France</hi> will have ≈øhare with us there, and the Crown the greate≈øt profit here? So that our <hi>Ea≈øt India Actions,</hi> as high as they are now may in a little time come as low as tho≈øe of the <hi>We≈øt India Company;</hi> which was once thought equal with the other, and are now next to nothing: and then many of us, who have mo≈øt of our e≈øtates adventured in the <hi>Ea≈øt-Indies</hi> Trade, may lo≈øe that we have le≈øt, as we have formerly lo≈øt by the <hi>We≈øt-Indies;</hi> and no remedy but patience, for we mu≈øt ≈øit down in a ≈øorrowful filence. Herein I have rea≈øon to ≈øpeak feelingly of my fears, being ≈øo concern'd according to the proportion of my ≈ømall e≈øtate; how much, mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters none but my ≈øelf, but were it ten times more, I mu≈øt tell you; that though the <hi>Actions</hi> at this pre≈øent are con≈øiderably above three hundred, I ≈øhall the fir≈øt day I ≈øee we come under <hi>France,</hi> ≈øell mine willingly for two, rather than keep them, and render many thanks to the buyer into the bargain.</p>
                  <p>Whereas on the other hand if we come under <hi>England,</hi> they have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly had, and ≈øtill have a con≈øiderable ≈øhare in the <hi>Ea≈øt India Trade.</hi> Their <hi>Company</hi> and ours accord well, and frequently accommodate each others corre≈øpondence.

Our fir≈øt capital of the <hi>Ea≈øt-India Company,</hi> is 64 Tun of Gold, and the <hi>Engli≈øh</hi> 40.

<pb facs="tcp:56430:37"/>the pre≈øent Argument. A diligent per≈øon calculated in the Year 62 the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendants on the <hi>Fi≈øhing-trade</hi> (I mean not Fi≈øhers only, but al≈øo all employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed about their ≈øhipping, Nets, Cask, Salt, &amp;c. with their Attendants at Sea) and reckoned them above 400000. Yea ≈øome have made their number far greater, particularly that learned, wi≈øe, and valiant Knight Sir <hi>Walter Rawleigh</hi> (whom I parallel with Sir <hi>Philip Sidney</hi>) in his information of King <hi>James,</hi> reckons our Ve≈ø≈øels that fi≈øh on the Coa≈øts of Great <hi>Britain</hi> 3000 and every 20 Bu≈ø≈øes to maintain 8000, which will amount to 1200000. But this is incredible. He mu≈øt either be mi≈øtaken in the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Ships, or the proportion he alots them, or both. For upon diligent enquiry I cannot find half that number either of Ships or Men in ≈øome years la≈øt pa≈øt. If he mean of the three ≈øeveral ≈øea≈øons of fi≈øhing; in Autumn for Herrings, Spring for Cod-fi≈øh, and Summer for Salmons; we ≈øhall not conte≈øt with him; nor concerning the number he ≈øays attends them, viz. 9000 other Ve≈ø≈øels, and 150000 Men.

                  <p n="3">3. By being under <hi>England,</hi> we might ≈øhare at lea≈øt with the <hi>Engli≈øh</hi> tho≈øe Plantations we have in the <hi>W. Indies; Holland</hi> in their <hi>New Netherland,</hi> and <hi>Zeeland</hi> in <hi>Surinam,</hi> &amp;c. Which would be of eminent advantage for Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, either there or to be ≈øent thither; be≈øides the profit we might have from tho≈øe Plantations; as <hi>Zeeland</hi> (or ≈øome at lea≈øt therein) even in the≈øe fir≈øt years and beginning thereof, have pretty well experienced, and know how greatly it is further improvable. Now what a ≈øingular benefit it is for a full and populous Common-wealth, now and then like the ≈øedulous Bees,
<pb facs="tcp:56430:38"/>to ca≈øt a ≈øwarm of their poore≈øt and mo≈øt laborious people, is apparent from the Hi≈øtories of all Ages. And though I confe≈øs the <hi>Dutch</hi> are not ≈øo good Planters, as the <hi>Engli≈øh,</hi> being more u≈øed to the Water, and the other to Land: yet in regard all tho≈øe <hi>Plantations</hi> are upon the Sea Coa≈øts and Rivers, the <hi>Dutch</hi> might be u≈øed for building of Ships or Boats, Hou≈øes &amp;c. and e≈øpecially for fi≈øhing, carrying and recarrying goods by Water on the Rivers, and to and from the Ships, and in navigation; and the <hi>Engli≈øh</hi> for planting and working in the ground; and ≈øo, in mine opinion, would make an excellent temperament, and very profitable for both Nations.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Expences might be ≈øaved in ≈øeveral Conveys, and particularly of the <hi>Ea≈øt India</hi> Companies.

Nay the <hi>States General</hi> bring in the≈øe, to be didu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted in the Accompt with <hi>England,</hi> as the occa≈øion thereof, in their <hi>Li≈øt of damages Article the 5. before the la≈øt War,</hi> A.

Such as are Rich, and weary of Trade, or love their ea≈øe, honour, or plea≈øure; may if we were under <hi>England,</hi> more ea≈øily remove thither, and be made <hi>liege</hi> ≈øubjects, and free <hi>Denizens</hi> of <hi>England</hi> by the <hi>Crown;</hi> or be <hi>naturalized</hi> by the <hi>Parliament;</hi> and ≈øo buy po≈ø≈øe≈øs, and inherit Lands and revenues at half the price here; and live upon their Rents as Country Gentlemen, in a cheap and plea≈øant Land, enjoying as great civil Liberty as any where in Chri≈øtendom, and al≈øo the freedom of their Religion. Or let out their money not only at far greater intere≈øt, but al≈øo upon <hi>bypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thece</hi> or real ≈øecurity. I have often thought this 20 years, whether it might not be better for <hi>England,</hi> to give this Liberty by Law to ≈øtrangers, e≈øpecially tho≈øe of the Reformed Religion, and of the≈øe Countries; and of which ≈øide the intere≈øt lay betwixt us for this: Now that <hi>England</hi> hath ≈øo many and great Plantations in the <hi>We≈øt Indies</hi> for their poorer people, now that money is ≈øo plentiful, now that this Common-wealth was ≈øo increa≈øed upon them, now that the Number of Merchants is every where ≈øo multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, and now that Trade is beaten ≈øo low, almo≈øt in all the known parts of the World.

               <p>ALthough what is ≈øaid of <hi>Religion, Liberty, E≈øtates,</hi> and <hi>Trade,</hi> be ≈øuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to prove this hypothetical problem? yet I ≈øhall give as over mea≈øure ≈øome other enducements for <hi>England</hi> briefly.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The different humor and genious of the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Dutch:</hi> which is well known to tho≈øe that know them both, to be far greater than between us and the <hi>Engli≈øh.</hi> Which makes not only a ≈øt<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ne≈øs, but alienation of affection; begets a di≈øgu≈øt and nau≈øeating of each other; brings forth many conte≈øts and quarrels; and nouri≈øhes a continual di≈øcontent, unea≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs, and unquietne≈øs of life.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The affection which the generallity of the <hi>Engli≈øh</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> Nation have for each other. So that if the Controver≈øies of late years, and at this pre≈øent between us, had been or were refered to the body of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in both Nations (although I well know what both their <hi>Repre≈øentatives</hi> have done) I dare ≈øay, upon rea≈øonable ≈øatisfaction for the mutual mi≈øcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages, which cannot but ≈øome times happen towards each other; there never had been, nor would be War betwixt us more. And that his <hi>Maje≈øty,</hi> and the <hi>Prince of Orange</hi> would have more Voluntiers in one day to fight the <hi>French,</hi> than they have in twenty to fight each other.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The way of <hi>France</hi> is only <hi>Gentry</hi> and <hi>Pai≈øantry,</hi> the former lording it over the latter, which have allways lived more mi≈øerably, than any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon people in <hi>Europe.</hi> In <hi>Cae≈øars</hi> time there was <hi>nibil plebe contemptius,</hi> as he tells us, and hath continued ≈øo as <hi>Bodin</hi> acknowledges, and is ≈øo at this day we all know.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>C.</hi> 1. <hi>C.</hi> 10.</note> Whereas in <hi>England</hi> and the≈øe <hi>Countries,</hi> there is a middle ≈øort of people, that live freely and independently, on their own Lands and Farmes, that will never endure the in≈øolency of ≈øuch Lords much le≈øs to be their ≈ølaves, and lea≈øt of all to be ruined by them.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Now that the <hi>Prince of Orange</hi> is advanced, and his party upmo≈øt, ≈øo that the Crown of <hi>England</hi> may confide more in our friend≈øhip; it is not to be doubted but through his <hi>Highne≈øs</hi> intere≈øt in his Uncles, we ≈øhall better accord hereafter, when the≈øe unhappy differences are once ended.</p>
               <p>And thus I have done with this great <hi>Que≈øtion</hi> of the times. Sufficiently, I thinke, to ≈øatisfie any rational man; though nothing is ≈øufficient, nor will ≈øatisfie I know, ≈øuch as are either ≈øo re≈øolvedly prejudiced again≈øt the <hi>Engli≈øh</hi> or Princes intere≈øt that if they can but ruin them, they matter not though they ruin both them≈øelves and the Nation; or ≈øo partially pa≈ø≈øionate for the <hi>French,</hi> that they de≈øire them, though it be to their own de≈øtruction. For all the Arguments in the World, will never prevail again≈øt pa≈ø≈øion and prejudice: It is only experience that can convince ≈øuch of their error, and make them with <hi>Damocles,</hi> when the drawn Sword is over them, de≈øire
<pb facs="tcp:56430:39"/>to depart, finding they were deceived in their opinion of Happine≈øs.</p>
               <p>I ≈øhall therefore conclude, with a brief reflection upon ≈øome of the≈øe Arguments, and the Corollary which naturally flows from them.</p>
               <p>That ≈øeeing <hi>England</hi> and We are of the ≈øame Religion; Both free people and affectionated to each other; Both imbarqued in the ≈øame Intere≈øt of Trade, though in different bottoms; It not only becomes us, but is our mutual concernment, that we take heed, we da≈øh not one another to pieces, but fairly and Chri≈øtianly comply with each other, for the ≈øafeguard of our Religion, pre≈øervation of the Prote≈øtant Intere≈øt, our own and others al≈øo Liberties, and the ju≈øt and equitable cour≈øe of Commerce; that ≈øo each Nation may happily enjoy their <hi>Religion, Liberty, E≈øtates,</hi> and <hi>Trade,</hi> with Gods ble≈ø≈øing on them all.</p>

               <p>Fir≈øt lets take a view of <hi>our own ≈øtrength,</hi> and ≈øee what grounds of encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement, that will yield us. Which though ≈øufficiently known to many, yet not ≈øo well to the multitude. Now the ≈øtrength of a Nation con≈øi≈øts e≈øpecially in the≈øe things following, which I ≈øhall briefly recite, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodate to our own <hi>Country.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. The great ≈øtrength of a people con≈øi≈øts in the <hi>≈øituation of their Country.</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:56430:40"/>Now concerning this both in the general,<note place="margin">Sect. 7.</note> and this Land in particular, I have already ≈øpoken ≈øufficiently for my purpo≈øe; and ≈øhewn that all the≈øe Maritime Provinces, are either I≈ølands or Penin≈øular, and very defen≈øible thereby; and al≈øo upon extremity liable to inundation, either from the Sea, or Rivers that ≈øurround them, or both.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In the Artificial Fortification of particular places; <hi>Cities, Ca≈øtles, Forts, Pa≈ø≈øes,</hi> &amp;c. And herein the≈øe Countries may contend with any Nation what≈øoever, Kingdom, or Common-wealth that is of no greater circumference. For the Number of their Cities, and their regular Forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, Art herein vying with Nature, is not to be parallel'd in the world. I need not de≈øcend to particulars, Tho≈øe that de≈øire ≈øatisfaction herein, may con≈øult <hi>Guicciardine</hi>'s de≈øcription of the≈øe Netherlands.</p>
               <p n="3">3. In means of defence. As ≈øhipping for tho≈øe Nations or Cities that lie upon the Sea, or great navigable Rivers, and Lakes, as the≈øe Provinces do, to defend their Coa≈øts from inva≈øion. And herein we are rather re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dundant than defective; the Number of ≈øhipping in <hi>Holland</hi> alone, being u≈øually accounted 20000. And warlike provi≈øion of Arms and Ammuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Wherein al≈øo we abound: the≈øe Countries ever ≈øince they were a Common-wealth, having been the greate≈øt Magazine of warlike provi≈øions, as is well known, of any in the World.</p>
               <p n="4">4. In men; in regard of their Number, Courage, Skill, and Una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimity.</p>
               <p>As to our Numbers, they are abundantly ≈øufficient for our defence. The <hi>Intere≈øt</hi> of <hi>Holland</hi> c. 8. from particulars, reckons the ≈øum of that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince alone 2400000. But if there be ≈øo many in them all, it is enow. Ju≈øt how many is impo≈ø≈øible to ≈øay, or near how many in ≈øuch a multitude is very difficult to gue≈øs, and harder with us than any other people, I think, in the World; in regard of the uncertainty of Seamen, the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Strangers and Travellers in peaceable times, and the diver≈øity of Religions, Jews, Papi≈øts, Anabapti≈øts, &amp;c. which bapti≈øe not their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren with us. But I know the Number of our men mu≈øt needs be great; by the great Number of our Cities, the≈øe ≈øeveral Provinces being as it were nothing but Ne≈øts of Cities, ≈øo many being no where to be found in ≈øo ≈ømall a circumference in any parts of the habitable World; by their largene≈øs and multitude of hou≈øes, which imply the Inhabitants to be many; by the greatne≈øs of their Trade, which is the lure that draws mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes to them; and by the known Chri≈øtnings and burials of tho≈øe only of the Reformed Religion.</p>
               <p>As to our courage, which at pre≈øent ≈øuffers an eclip≈øe, there is more to be ≈øaid then the World is aware of. And indeed I wonder none of our Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtory Profe≈ø≈øors, have given other Nations ≈øome ≈øatisfaction herein. I have not been without ≈øome thoughts of doing it my ≈øelf, having been a diligent ob≈øerver how things have gone, but I want Authentick materials for ≈øuch a work. I could produce very many and very honourable te≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies,
<pb facs="tcp:56430:40"/>both ancient and modern of their valour, our of ≈øuch Writers as give the Characters of Nations, Republicks, Geographers, and e≈øpecially Hi≈øtorians <hi>Dion, Cae≈øar, Tacitus, Suetonius, Florus, Oro≈øius,</hi> &amp;c. of old, the famous <hi>Italians, Guicciardine, Bentivoglio</hi> and <hi>Strada,</hi> with <hi>Spani≈øh, French, Engli≈øh</hi> and the neighbouring Nations, even ≈øo many and ≈øuch as are ≈øufficient either to ≈øhame, or to inflame the verie≈øt cowards, one ≈øhould think, of the world into courage. But this would be too large to in≈øert here, and may po≈ø≈øibly de done in another dre≈øs hereafter. Nor is the ≈øucce≈øs of <hi>France</hi> again≈øt us ≈øuch a wonder, as many make it, as I have formerly ≈øhewn.<note place="margin">Sect. 7.</note> I will at pre≈øent only add, that which is proper for this place, and that is that the <hi>French</hi> Armies were not only ≈øo numerous, but al≈øo trained up in the School of <hi>Mars,</hi> and ours for the mo≈øt part raw and unexperienced in War. As the Fox in the Fable, the fir≈øt time he ≈øaw the Lion and heard him roar, trembled; the ≈øecond time, was le≈øs affraid, and the third grown wholly fearle≈øs of him: So it is with men, by being accu≈øtomed to dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers either at Sea or Land, they conver≈øe with them familiary, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count them nothing at la≈øt. And therefore wi≈øe Commanders have always endeavoured to unlearn their Souldiers fear, by ≈øhewing them their enemies at Walls, Trenches, Pa≈ø≈øes, Rivers or other places, where they could not be come upon by them, and ≈øo harden and fle≈øh them by degrees, before they have adventured to fight them again≈øt old and experienced ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. And I doubt not, but through Gods ble≈ø≈øing, in a little time if the Wars continue, our Belgick Lion, will not be found ≈øuch a tame Lamb, and ≈øo ea≈øily torn in pieces, as our enemies may hope, and others po≈ø≈øibly may imagin.</p>
               <p>As for our skill ≈øuperadded to courage, there is no want, for the manner of defence we are to make. For be≈øides our able Commanders and Souldiers to defend the Po≈øts, and Pa≈ø≈øes abroad, all our Cities abound with Seamen, and ≈øuch as are skil'd to traver≈øe their Ordnance, and de≈øperate for ≈øallies, if need ≈øhould require.</p>
               <p>Our unanimity, I confe≈øs, is that I mo≈øt fear: and that when our Cities are threatned with danger, the Citizens ≈øhould grow mutinous, and fall together by the ears, and ≈øo let in their enemies to part the fray. And yet I have rea≈øon to think they will grow wi≈øer, by their hearing and knowing how their freinds are u≈øed by their enemies.</p>
               <p n="5">5. In money and food to maintain their men. And in neither of the≈øe, through Gods mercy, is there any want among≈øt us: If we will lay out our ≈øelves, as we ought, for the publick. <hi>Ait≈øma's Liewe</hi> reckons the publick incoms of <hi>Holland</hi> alone A. 1643. at eleven Millions of our money, which is eleven hundred thou≈øand pounds Sterling: we calling every ten thou≈øand pound Sterling a tun of gold, and ever hundred thou≈øand a million <hi>i. e.</hi> of gilders. And be≈øides the publick incoms of every Province, every City hath their peculiar, which in ≈øome is very con≈øiderble. But if our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Trea≈øuries are exhau≈øted in ≈øeveral places, it is no wonder: Yet if we
<pb facs="tcp:56430:41"/>con≈øider the Riches of particular per≈øons, we have enough to hold out the War, to weary our enemies out at the la≈øt, as mu≈øt as they do us at the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øent. I will not now ≈øtand to ≈øhew the calculation of this, though if nece≈ø≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, I think I can do it ≈øatisfactorily, comprehending the di≈øadvantages our enemies are under. But the late Project printed ≈øo often, of the <hi>Capitals</hi> of this Country, for rai≈øing and maintaining ≈øo numerous an Army, though the manner pre≈øcribed prove not practicable, hath in part ≈øpared my pains herein.</p>
               <p>And for food, our Cities are generally ≈øo well furni≈øhed, that if our enemies ≈øteal not ≈øupplies from us, it is well; we need neither ≈øeek to them, nor fight with them for ≈øupplying our ≈øelves. We have Bread Corn Fi≈øh and Oyl, Butter and Chee≈øe in abundance. And if our liquori≈øh Dames, want their delicacies a while, no great matter: they will value peace, and pay their Souldiers the better.</p>
               <p>Now what can be added for the ≈øufficient defence of any Nation, to the particulars mentioned, I cannot imagin; and if my enumeration be in≈øuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient, I wi≈øh any wi≈øe man would ≈øhew wherein, and then I ≈øhall thank them. And therefore let us take courage to our ≈øelves, and not be frighted with vain fears; or ≈øcared with any vanting bravadoes; like that great <hi>Rhodomontadoe</hi> of the grand <hi>Turk,</hi> who when he heard of the long War ≈øuch a great Prince as <hi>Spain,</hi> made about this ≈ømall Country; ≈øaid, <hi>that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he would have kept ≈øuch a pottering, about a few petty Provinces, he would have taken them, and hurled them into the Sea at once:</hi> though his ≈øucce≈ø≈øor kept no ≈ømall pottering about the ≈øingle City of <hi>Candia</hi> many years to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; to which ≈øome of our Cities, all things con≈øidered, ≈øeem not much inferior for ≈øtrength: although I well know what a difference there is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the defence of one City alone without a Country, and many at once contained therein.</p>
               <p>But though this <hi>internal ≈øtrength</hi> be ≈øo con≈øiderable, and with us of great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>e≈øt con≈øequence; yet this is not all; we have al≈øo an <hi>external and accidental ≈øtrength,</hi> by the Intere≈øt of our Neighbours. For this end it mu≈øt be well con≈øidered, that ≈øome Countries and Cities, of ≈ømall ≈øtrength compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively in them≈øelves, are yet very ≈øtrong by their ≈øituation among, and well ≈øecured by the Intere≈øt of other circumjacent Princes and States: who will not ≈øuffer, if they can po≈ø≈øibly prevent it, acce≈ø≈øion of ≈øtrength to one another, le≈øt their own ≈øcale in the ballance of powers ≈øhould become light and ≈øoon born down. What is it but this under the ≈øhadow of the Almighties Protection, that ≈øecures the ≈ømaller Republicks in <hi>Italy</hi> and the <hi>Empire?</hi> What <hi>Geneva, Stratsburg, Colen, Hamburg</hi> and the re≈øt of the free Cities, and <hi>Hans Towns,</hi> but this? God governing the World u≈øually, as both <hi>Comines</hi> and <hi>Cardan</hi> well ob≈øerve, by the pa≈ø≈øions of men, in the ballancing of Powers; that when any one will break out into rage and Wars, others will oppo≈øe them with the like fury, and ≈øo keep the World a little quiet, otherwi≈øe the great <hi>Nimrods,</hi> and hunters after Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
<pb facs="tcp:56430:41"/>would ≈øoon, if let alone, de≈øtroy and devour all before them.</p>
               <p>Now if we look about us, and ≈øee among≈øt whom our Land lies, and well con≈øider their intere≈øt; this will be very apparent in our ≈øelves, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with≈øtanding this War that is made again≈øt us, that we are not devoted by any to de≈øtruction, but only the <hi>French,</hi> as I ≈øhall ≈øhew hereafter.</p>
               <p>For <hi>Spain</hi> our next Neighbours on one hand, in the re≈øt of the Provinces, they know this ≈øo well, and are ≈øo ≈øen≈øible of their intere≈øt herein; that they not only a≈ø≈øi≈øt us what they can; but I dare ≈øay were it not for <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> would rather break with <hi>France</hi> than ≈øee us endangered.

And to ≈øay the truth, this was the greate≈øt error in Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy by way of omi≈ø≈øion, and that of <hi>Charles</hi> the 8. concerning the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Naples</hi> of commi≈ø≈øion, that I think the Crown of <hi>France</hi> was ever guilty of. And indeed there were many of the <hi>Engli≈øh</hi> Nation, that judged it one of the greate≈øt over≈øights that that wi≈øe Prince≈øs ever made, not to take into her hands, as ≈øhe was offered, the ab≈øolut protection of the≈øe Provinces. But that is not ≈øo clear to me, nor will be ≈øo I think to others, who rightly con≈øider the circum≈øtances of tho≈øe times; for we mu≈øt not judge by the following, wherein this Common-wealth grew up beyond all expectation, under ≈øuch Wars, as many feared would have been our de≈øtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. But yet though ≈øhe refu≈øed for ≈øeveral rea≈øons both of Con≈øcience and State (mentioned by <hi>Cambden</hi> in her <hi>Annals,</hi> A.D. 1575.) yet it plainly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by the forementioned places in <hi>Thuanus,</hi> that rather than the <hi>French</hi> ≈øhould, ≈øhe would have done it. And could ≈øhe have fore≈øeen, what we have known, I am apt to think ≈øhe would have adventured it; although I mu≈øt tell you it would have been a great venture: <hi>Spain</hi> being both ≈øo potent at that time, and ≈øpightful again≈øt her, as was quickly after perceived, by the <hi>Spani≈øh Armado</hi> in 88. and be≈øides the enmity of <hi>Spain,</hi> ≈øhe had thereby in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur'd the envy of <hi>France</hi> infallibly, and was uncertain not only of ≈øucce≈øs in the War, but of what ≈øupport of men, and money e≈øpecially the <hi>Dutch</hi> ≈øhould be able to contribute, for the carrying on the War, which was ea≈øily fore≈øeen would be long and bloody.</p>
               <p>Nor can any one think, that <hi>England</hi> is not ≈øen≈øible, of the danger they are in, if we be under <hi>France,</hi> that either con≈øiders the Rea≈øons of State, or obe≈øerved that which was obvious to every eye: and that is how the <hi>Engli≈øh</hi> was ≈øtartled at the progre≈øs of <hi>France.</hi> What po≈øting was made too and again?

               <p>It will be ≈øaid to me why then ≈øhould <hi>England</hi> commence this War.</p>
               <p>Truly let me ≈øay it freely, for I know it, that the ≈øcale of War very hardly ca≈øt that of peace, and the difference was ≈øo ≈ømall, that it came upon two or three grains only. I have weighed this as exactly as I po≈ø≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly could: fir≈øt di≈øtingui≈øhing pretexts from real cau≈øes, and then di≈øtinctly con≈øidering the≈øe one by one. There were the≈øe 5 variou≈øly di≈øcour≈øed of. His Maje≈øties de≈øigning to introduce the Popi≈øh Religion; to alter the government of tho≈øe Kingdoms; to revenge him≈øelf upon us, to advance the <hi>Prince of Orange;</hi> and the Intere≈øt of the Kingdom of <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the two fir≈øt which made the loude≈øt noi≈øe in ≈øome mens mouths, I ≈øoon found them frivolous; and only calumnies ca≈øt out by his enemies at home and abroad, to make the King odious, and his People jealous. As to that of changing Religion I have formerly ≈øhewn, and I think ≈øufficiently, that he neither will, nor can if he would effect it.</p>
               <p>As for the 2d. I con≈øidered the Kings years, as being pa≈øt any ≈øuch youth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and vain ambition; his being de≈øtitute of a Child that can challenge the Crown; his former mi≈øeries and ≈øufferings by War; and his wi≈ødom too great, to ≈øet upon a de≈øign, ≈øo wholly impracticable, e≈øpecially in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland.</hi> For by the con≈øtitution of his Kingdoms, though he have the <hi>Militis</hi> for the execution of the Laws; authority without power, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a vain ≈øcare crow, and in≈øufficient to ≈øuppre≈øs the audacious exorbitances of the multitude: yet the people have the pur≈øe to ballance that power, and whence then would he pay his Armies? Nor let any one ≈øtop me with ≈øay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the Long Parliament conte≈øted with his Father for the <hi>Militia;</hi> for that was only temporary, they challenging it only for that time of the danger they apprehended in the Kingdom, and not as their con≈øtant right, and not belonging to the Crown; as may be ≈øeen by tho≈øe, who will rightly read their Declarations, which they publi≈øhed to the world concerning that War, collected and printed together by <hi>Husbands</hi> at <hi>London,</hi> 1642. And be≈øides this, a Parliament in being though not ≈øitting, which hath
<pb facs="tcp:56430:43"/>≈øome kind of radical power; though not to be exerted, but when legally congregated. But ≈øuppo≈øe them di≈ø≈øolved, it being in the Kings power, to do it at his plea≈øure; yet hath he not the City of <hi>London</hi> on his back, and both Kingdoms about him to oppo≈øe him? e≈øpecially con≈øidering that the jealou≈øie of Popery would be taken into the quarrel. And what Mini≈øters of State dur≈øt ≈øugge≈øt ≈øuch de≈øigns? they know well the maxim of the <hi>Commons</hi> and their practice (as the great means of pre≈øerving their freedom) is <hi>to ruine ≈øuch as would infringe their Liberty.</hi> And that they are ≈øo jealous of, and zealous for their rights herein, that ≈øome of them ≈øtill have the courage, and re≈øolution to venture their own heads, to break the necks of ≈øuch men and ≈øuch defigns, as would prejudice their Priviledges. I have ob≈øerved in the Hi≈øtories of former times, and in my own time al≈øo, that there were ≈øeldom any of the noble≈øt Stags of State, how much ≈øoever imparked in the Kings favour, and how ≈øtrongly ≈øoever impaled with power; but if the <hi>Commons</hi> of <hi>England</hi> ≈øingled him out and ≈øet upon him, though he might hold them at an abay for ≈øome time, yet they ≈øtill hunted him down at la≈øt. And for the King to think of making him≈øelf ab≈øolute, and govern only by an Army (like the <hi>French</hi> Kings) by an Army of <hi>French</hi> men; is ≈øo ridiculous, that I thought it not worthy of con≈øideration. Can any man in his wits, imagine his Maje≈øty of <hi>England</hi> ≈øo ≈øen≈øele≈øs, as to give his Crown and Kingdoms to the <hi>French</hi> King? For that is all one with this in effect.</p>
               <p>As for that of <hi>Revenge,</hi> either for <hi>Chattam,</hi> or the affronts mentioned in his Declaration of this War, or both: I con≈øidered his <hi>Temper,</hi> which hath ≈øo much <hi>Clemency,</hi> that it rather inclines him to <hi>lenity</hi> than <hi>cruelty</hi> and <hi>revenge.</hi> As is abundantly apparent, not only by pa≈ø≈øing, but even forcing (as I know he did, again≈øt ≈øome adicted to the latter extreme) the <hi>Act of Indemnity</hi> or <hi>Oblivion,</hi> for tho≈øe many and great injuries, he had ≈øuffered from his Subjects. And his government ≈øince, in conniving at the viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ≈øuch Laws, as are thought ≈øevere in matters of Religion, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulging liberty therein: which hath made ≈øome, that have ≈øufficiently heretofore cried up Parliaments, now run into the other extreme and cry them down as fa≈øt; and in≈øtead of the Parliaments formerly, now magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the Kings favour and Clemency. And yet Kings and Princes are men, and men ≈øubject to like pa≈ø≈øions with others, liable to ≈øugge≈øtions from tho≈øe about them, and tender of their honour as the apple of their eye. And therefore I will grant this might come in con≈øideration, but not ≈øo much, I dare ≈øay, as alone to make a War.</p>
               <p>For the <hi>Prince of Orange,</hi> there was not only near Relation and Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, but Intere≈øt al≈øo to be con≈øidered. For the <hi>Love≈øteyns</hi> party having been ≈øo cro≈øs to <hi>England</hi> upon his account, and the corre≈øpondent friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øhip between us ≈øo uncertain, without his Head≈øhip; I verily believe, that if what is now done therein, had been done timou≈øly, it had wholly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented this unhappy War. Yea be≈øides the extraordinary affection which
<pb facs="tcp:56430:43"/>the people have for the Prince, our very Bores had this Policy, and were more than ordinary zealous for his promotion, as the be≈øt means to procure their peace.</p>
               <p>As to the further intere≈øt of the Kingdom of <hi>England,</hi> in regard of their Trade, and Naval expences, I have expre≈ø≈øed my thoughts before in the <hi>Preface.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is true, this War was always intricate, and hath proved a Game at Hazard for <hi>England,</hi> beyond not only theirs, I believe, but all the worlds expectation. But yet if it be ≈øtill notwith≈øtanding cautiou≈øly played, as they may, and ≈øo far as I can po≈ø≈øibly di≈øcern, mean to play it; they can many ways come to ≈øave their ≈øtakes, at the lea≈øt, if not to win more than we imagine by the War: and was far fairer at fir≈øt than <hi>France</hi> for win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning by the game in all humane appearance, as I could manife≈øt by many Arguments. But becau≈øe that concerns them two only, and us not at all further than our ≈øufferings, I ≈øhall wave them (at lea≈øt for the pre≈øent) and proceed. For I will not hearken to the curious enquiries of tho≈øe who would here be asking, how I think <hi>England</hi> will play their game? for that let them look to it whom it concerns on all ≈øides, as doubtle≈øs they will; for me to expre≈øs my private thoughts, might do more hurt than good, which is the only thing I aim at: and what I think the i≈ø≈øue will be, I ≈øhall declare hereafter in my <hi>Conjectures.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But here it will be asked, ≈øeeing it is <hi>Englands</hi> intere≈øt that we fall not into the hands of <hi>France,</hi> and that the Prince is now promoted, will they not make peace with us this Winter?</p>
               <p>I mu≈øt needs ≈øay, I fear they will not, except we ≈øhould give them ≈øuch terms, as I ≈øee we ≈øhall not; we thinking our condition far better, and they thinking it far wor≈øe, than really it is. For the cau≈øe of this, as of mo≈øt Wars, is complex, as I have ≈øhewn; ≈øo that though two of tho≈øe I a≈ø≈øigned may be pa≈øt, yet the 3<hi rend="sup">d</hi> of the Kingdoms intere≈øt, not. They are already too far ingaged in the War, and with <hi>France.</hi> The Kings Honour is at the ≈øtake, and the Kingdoms expectation of another i≈ø≈øae than the la≈øt War. And be≈øides all the≈øe, how can any wi≈øe man imagine, now that they are engaged with <hi>France,</hi> and have an advantage again≈øt us, as well as a Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard from <hi>France;</hi> that if they know how to ≈øecure them≈øelves again≈øt the latter (as I ≈øuppo≈øe they do) they will let go the former? For we mu≈øt needs think they will be at a certainty on one ≈øide or the other; and not part with <hi>France's</hi> friend≈øhip, till they be ≈øure of our ≈øatisfaction. What it is they demand, or how rightly, is not now our de≈øign to di≈øcour≈øe, but only matter of Intere≈øt all along. And yet I can ea≈øily fore≈øee that the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of our becoming <hi>French,</hi> will be a ≈øingular advantage to us, as an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducement to them, for a more ea≈øie compliance with us. But at pre≈øent I ≈øee no probability of Peace, but that they will go through with the War: or continue it ≈øo long, till they have tryed their utmo≈øt to obtain their ends.</p>
               <p>I know there are many wi≈øe men among≈øt us, that think the King can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb facs="tcp:56430:44"/>carry on this War: as there was that thought he could not begin it. The former they find them≈øelves deceived in, and will be ≈øo in the latter al≈øo. I have di≈øcour≈øed this with ≈øeveral in Government, who argue that the King hath not money of him≈øelf to go through with the War, and that he will not convene the Parliament, or if he do they will not ≈øupply him. I grant the fir≈øt, but deny the others. For if we rightly con≈øider their defign, the Parliament mu≈øt meet, and the repre≈øentation that will be made thereof, and the con≈øtitution of the Parliament, they will grant him ≈øupplies; though perhaps not with that facility, that they did it with in the former War. And therefore let us neither flatter nor deceive our ≈øelves with vain hopes herein; but rather ≈øeek timely to accommodate differences, before their preparations in the Spring; for I fear the longer we delay, and the wor≈øe it will be with us.</p>

               <p>HAving thus declared the condition that we are in, and that there is no probability of peace; we come now to ≈øhew the con≈øequences thereof; and what is to be done by us, to pre≈øerve our ≈øelves from ruine and de≈øtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.

We ≈øhall fir≈øt declare our thoughts concerning the≈øe briefly, and then ≈øhew with which we both may and mu≈øt comply.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Then whether we ≈øhould continue the War again≈øt them both. And herein would we do, as we might and ≈øhould; it may be this were better, than to comply with either of them, e≈øpecially if they will impo≈øe upon us unrea≈øonable conditions, and much better than to comply with them both. We have ≈øtrength enough, through Gods ble≈ø≈øing, to with≈øtand them (as I have already manife≈øted) if we have but courage, and unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity; and the former of the≈øe will be got by degrees, as I have ≈øaid, and our own intere≈øt, and pre≈øervation ≈øhould per≈øwade us into the latter. But truly let me ≈øay it freely, I ≈øee ≈øuch a wearine≈øs in many of the War; ≈øuch an unwillingne≈øs to lay out our ≈øelves, as our Ance≈øtors did formerly, for the good of the publick; ≈øuch a ≈øelfi≈øh temper, every one ≈øeeking to pre≈øerve his particular intere≈øt, and neglecting the good of the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; and ≈øuch a lothne≈øs to adventure our lives and e≈øtates in a War; that I ≈øee little probability of pre≈øerving our ≈øelves, and much le≈øs of prevalency again≈øt our Enemies. So that if this War continue I fear the≈øe Provinces will become a prey to them both. For though neither <hi>France</hi> will ≈øuffer <hi>England,</hi> nor <hi>England France</hi> to have them all, as I have ≈øhewn; yet they will part and ≈øhare them betwixt them, except we prevent it by a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance.
<pb facs="tcp:56430:44"/>And what a mi≈øerable condition we ≈øhall then be in, even wor≈øe than if we were under either of them, I have formerly declared.

If the former, let me encourage all in the words of <hi>Joab</hi> that great General and brave Souldier wherewith he encouraged the <hi>I≈øraelites,</hi> when he had his enemies before and behind him, <hi>Be of good courage, and let us play the men for our people and for the Cities of our God: and the Lord do that which ≈øeemeth him good.</hi>

               <p n="3">3. There is no way therefore left us, but to comply with one of our Enemies, if we can po≈ø≈øibly; that ≈øo we may ballance the others power, and either compel him to a peace, or be enabled to continue the War. If any one know any other way, I heartily wi≈øh he would ≈øhew it, as I think he is bound to do one way or other; for every one ought to contribute his be≈øt a≈ø≈øi≈øtance, even by the principles of ≈øelf-pre≈øervation.<note place="margin">

               <p>It is objected that the two Crowns are in a League, that neither will treat without the other, and how can we then comply with <hi>England</hi> alone?</p>
               <p>I confe≈øs if all State≈ømen were <hi>Ari≈øtides</hi>'s,<note place="margin">Plutarch. in vita Ari≈øtid.</note> the Argument might be ≈øtrong.

Nay what if I ≈øhould ≈øay, there may be none iniquity in this? If I ≈øhould, I think I can prove it, for if in mutual covenants, either ≈øide do that, which is a breach; it is folly
<pb facs="tcp:56430:45"/>to think, that the innocent ≈øhould be bound, and the peccant party free, which they may know, though others do not, as it is clear in the ≈øtronge≈øt covenant, that is in the World, I mean that of wedlock. I do not ≈øay that this is ≈øo betwixt them, but I ≈øay it may be ≈øo though we do not know it, ≈øo that either of them in ≈øuch ca≈øe, may conclude with us. And I am ≈øure it is no di≈øhone≈øty on our part.</p>
               <p>But it will here be ≈øaid, they will not.</p>
               <p>Do not tell me that, I know they either of them will. And if any one asks me, how? and if I be of their Cabinet Council? I ≈øhall only ≈ømile, perceiving they do not know me. I am far from that, or having ever to do with Kings or States in that kind, or pragmatically trinketing with State affairs, it being a Rule which I live by, <hi>never to ask great men mercy.</hi> Common favour and ju≈øtice I de≈øire of men, but mercy only of my God. And yet I know this very well, and I will tell you how, and that is from their <hi>Intere≈øt;</hi> which is the compa≈øs, by which all States-men ≈øteer their cour≈øe, and may be di≈øcerned by a skilful pa≈ø≈øenger, although he ≈øit not at the helm.

But yet I may ≈øay, that for above 20 years I have ob≈øerved, that the cu≈øtom of the World carries it with them, and have known few, I had almo≈øt ≈øaid none, of the ≈øtricte≈øt Sect of the <hi>Phari≈øees;</hi> though I have ≈øome, and my charity obliges me to hope there are many, that ≈øeriou≈øly mind the <hi>weightier things of the Law, ju≈øtice, righteou≈ønes, temperance, and the World to come.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now that this is the Intere≈øt of both the Kings, rather to deal with us apart, than jointly, as well as ours, I could many ways make apparent. But ≈øeeing it is our intere≈øt to chu≈øe <hi>England</hi> we ≈øhall prove only that it is theirs to comply with us; omitting that of <hi>France,</hi> as ≈øuperfluous to our purpo≈øe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. They know they cannot wholly conquer us them≈øelves. Not only in regard of our own ≈øtrength, of which I haven ≈øpoken before, but the <hi>French,</hi> which are in the Country already, and if they were not, would never permit it, as I have formerly ≈øhown ≈øufficiently. Nay I dare ≈øay, they never de≈øigned any ≈øuch thing, becau≈øe they know it is impracticable: that being always true of the Greeks, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>„Äà in non-Latin alphabet „Äâ</desc>
                  </gap> or things im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈ø≈øible come not into con≈øideration. I doubt not but they both intend and hope to have their ≈øhare, what ever it is that is agreed upon between the two Crowns, in ca≈øe of Conque≈øt; but that they ≈øhould have the whole, could never ≈øo much as be dreamt of by them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. They know al≈øo that it is their intere≈øt, never to ≈øuffer <hi>France</hi> have all, no nor any of the≈øe Maritime Provinces. If he have ≈øome of the ≈øu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior,
<pb facs="tcp:56430:46"/>that is the utmo≈øt their intere≈øt can permit. Nay indeed he is nearer the≈øe inferior, than that will allow, if they could help it, but that's now pa≈øt. What va≈øt di≈øadvantage it will be to the <hi>Engli≈øh,</hi> to let <hi>France</hi> have footing upon our Coa≈øts, and ≈øo come to cope with them at Sea, I have formerly ≈øhown: and I know they are very ≈øen≈øible of it; and therefore may well infer a willingne≈øs on their parts to a compliance.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The <hi>Prince of Orange</hi> his intere≈øt being al≈øo theirs, cannot but ≈øway ≈øomething with them. For if it had been Gods will, tho≈øe Kingdoms had continued in peace, and the ≈øucce≈ø≈øion of the Royal reign uninterrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted there, and the <hi>Orange</hi> family continued alive and in power here, I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øwade my ≈øelf we ≈øhould never have warred with one another; ≈øo I doubt not, if it plea≈øe God to pre≈øerve his Highne≈øs, that they may confide more in our friend≈øhip, than they could formerly, he will be a happy In≈øtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a better under≈øtanding between the Nations, when the≈øe unhappy quarrels come once to be compo≈øed; becau≈øe this is their intere≈øt as well as ours, and it is intere≈øt that rules and reigns in the World.</p>
               <p>And thus I have ≈øhewn you that we <hi>may,</hi> I ≈øhall now ≈øhew briefly that we <hi>mu≈øt comply</hi> with them, or without a miracle of mercy we are ruined.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becau≈øe if the War continues, and we be too weak to make ≈øtrong re≈øi≈øtance, ≈øo that our enemies prevail; they will ≈øhare the Country be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt them, and then we fall into the wor≈øt condition, that can po≈ø≈øibly befal us. It is true, I fore≈øee that ≈øeveral particular Per≈øons may ≈øave them≈øelves and their e≈øtates, by friends on the one ≈øide or the other; but I ≈øpeak of the community; and it is well if the hopes many have of that, make them not more negligent for this. There are two famous Republicks in <hi>Italy, Venice</hi> and <hi>Genoa;</hi> and what is the cau≈øe of the formers flouri≈øhing ≈øo much more than the latter, which was anciently both their better and their Ma≈øter? but this, that the <hi>Venetians</hi> are more intent upon the Publick, and the <hi>Genoe≈øe</hi> upon their private concernments: whereby they become obnoxious not only to many factions among them≈øelves, but al≈øo to oppre≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øions from their Neighbours. I could ≈øay more herein of our ≈øelves, than I ≈øhall at pre≈øent, in regard it might create more jealou≈øies (which are already too many) of tho≈øe that are, or at lea≈øt have been, in Government among≈øt us. But though I will accu≈øe none, yet I mu≈øt needs ≈øay, that I a≈øcribe a great part of our pre≈øent mi≈øeries to this <hi>Genoan</hi> practice; and heartily wi≈øh, this prove not fatal to us at la≈øt.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Becau≈øe if we be not ≈øen≈øele≈øs we may clearly ≈øee, that <hi>France's</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øign is ab≈øolutely to conquer us: whereas <hi>England</hi> ≈øeeks only (to u≈øe their expre≈ø≈øion) their own ≈øecurity. And therefore in my Logick the inference is plain, that we had better part with ≈øomething, than lo≈øe all, as we are like to do, if we come not to a compliance with <hi>England.</hi> To make the≈øe apparent to any wi≈øe man, would be the lighting a Torch to the Sun. Although I know the quite contrary is ca≈øt out among us by the friends of <hi>France,</hi> who would per≈øwade us, that the <hi>French</hi> ≈øeek only to humble
<pb facs="tcp:56430:46"/>us, and the <hi>Engli≈øh</hi> to conquer us. But we know the minding of men, is but ≈øhooting at random, and that he that means to come near the truth, mu≈øt have his eye upon the <hi>mark of intere≈øt,</hi> which cannot lye, as men do frequently for it. If any be ≈øo fooli≈øh, as to be enchanted with ≈øuch <hi>Syrens</hi> ≈øongs, as are daily ≈øung among≈øt us; and have more regard to publick news, than the intere≈øt of Nations; they may go on, I cannot hinder them: but let me tell them, that I fear they will find at la≈øt, the Poets fiction a real truth; and if they ≈øtear their own cour≈øe, meet with the Seamens fate in the Fable, be ≈øung a ≈øleep for a time, that ≈øo they may be afterwards, with greater facility drowned and devoured.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Becau≈øe there is no other way or humane means le≈øt us (≈øo far as I can di≈øcern) of the Common-wealths continuation. And this is the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion that follows clearly from the premi≈øes. For if we be unable to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtand them both, or ≈øatisfie them both, we mu≈øt either break their confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deracy, and have the help of one of them, or the Republick will be ruined.</p>
               <p>It will here be demanded, ≈øeeing it is both <hi>Englands</hi> intere≈øt and our own to accord, why do we not then come to a compliance.</p>
               <p>I will tell you why. Becau≈øe we judge our Condition better, and they judge it wor≈øe, than really it is; and therefore ≈øtand upon greater terms, than we will give them. We think things will go better with us in time, and they think they will grow wor≈øe. We flatter our ≈øelves with vain hopes, and rely upon <hi>Brandenburgs</hi> A≈ø≈øi≈øtance, <hi>Spains</hi> breaking with our enemies, the <hi>Parliament of Englands</hi> not ≈øupplying that King to carry on the War, and the like, when they know the quite contrary in all humane appearance. <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                  </gap>or perhaps we are afraid to irritate <hi>France,</hi> if we ≈øhould make overtures to <hi>England;</hi> and <hi>England</hi> will not give ≈øuch an umbrage of jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lou≈øie to <hi>France,</hi> as to tamper with us, except they be fir≈øt a≈ø≈øured from us of ≈øatisfaction. But cannot the effecting this be put into the hands of his <hi>Highne≈øs</hi> and a few others as it was lately, to be privately tran≈øacted by them? Here then it is that the ≈øhooe pinches, We are a popular State, the people ≈øtill think, till an enemy comes, they can defend them≈øelves, and therefore our Governors dare not adventure to tender <hi>England</hi> ≈øuch ≈øati≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, as (for ought I ≈øee) they will have; le≈øt they either ≈øhould not be able to perform it, or if they do, ≈øhould lo≈øe them≈øelves with the people. And therefore I fore≈øee, the War will be continued, till we be reduced to that condition, that we ≈øhall be nece≈ø≈øitated to give them both their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, by publick tran≈øaction, or at lea≈øt that way break with one of them. And on this foundation, I ≈øhall now proceed, to gue≈øs at that which I think is mo≈øt likely to befal us.</p>

               <p>Now that we may be quickned to defend our ≈øelves, comply with <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi> and free the <hi>Spani≈øh Netherlands</hi> from their fears, and our ≈øelves from the neighbourhood of the <hi>French</hi> there, (this being one Rea≈øon of State, why we formerly made peace with <hi>Spain,</hi> le≈øt we ≈øhould be in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual danger of annoyance from <hi>France</hi>) and al≈øo render their maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Conque≈øts among us more difficult, by their being kept uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected with that Kingdom: I ≈øhall now proceed to the <hi>Conjectures</hi> I have made, not with an A≈øtrological confidence, but a Chri≈øtian allowance of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine providence, which ≈øtrangely alters times and ≈øea≈øons, puls down one and ≈øets up another, confounds the wi≈ødom of the wi≈øe, brings to nought the coun≈øels of <hi>Achitophels,</hi> and turns the great de≈øigns and preparations for War, into a happy compliance, and peace as he plea≈øes; and all in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite wi≈ødom, though we cannot di≈øcern it, the knowledge of Gods

Yet I conclude they will have ≈øome hanke or other upon our Navall power, one way or other, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they make Peace with us; otherwi≈øe they will continue the War the following Summer, to try their utmo≈øt to get, that which we will not give them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>France</hi> that is allready got into the Sadle, will there ≈øit and ride us; though we flatter our ≈øelves, we ≈øhall by one means or other, ≈øhake him out of it, and off our backs. Truly I cannot but wonder often times, to heare what vaine hopes men expres and there's no contradicting them; (allthough ≈øome times I cannot conteine my ≈øelfe from ≈ømiling, or ≈øhakeing my head) that <hi>France</hi> mu≈øt be content with one or two of our Cities which we can be≈øt ≈øpare, and with a confidence allmo≈øt as large, as if they was ready to run way, or re≈øolved to march out and quit tho≈øe Cities they have, at our plea≈øure. As if the <hi>French</hi> were ≈øuch ≈øooles, to be at that va≈øt expence, great paines, even the King him≈øelfe per≈øonally, and have
<pb facs="tcp:56430:48"/>≈øuch advantage upon us, and quit the ≈øame for a thing of nothing? For my part, I am affraid they will rather get more, then lo≈øe that they have gotten already. And I know, their de≈øigne is, to get all at la≈øt. It is true, if we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with <hi>England,</hi> and ≈øo ≈øtrengthen our ≈øelves by them and <hi>Spaine,</hi> we may thereby hope either to obteine better conditions by Treaty, or compel them thereunto by Force. But I am ≈øpeaking of the ≈øtate of the War, as now it ≈øtands.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Colen,</hi> that pretends to ≈øome of tho≈øe Cities which we held about the <hi>Rhyne,</hi> that are now in the power and po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of the <hi>French,</hi> may po≈ø≈øibly for his paines, and permi≈ø≈øion of their pa≈ø≈øage, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> get ≈øome <hi>≈øupernumerary girth,</hi> one place or other that may be of no great concernment to <hi>France,</hi> either for their de≈øignes upon us or the Empire, and mu≈øt be contented there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with. And perhaps for ≈øome time his Coun≈øellors may have their Pen≈øions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued from <hi>France.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mun≈øter,</hi> that is mercinary and fights for Money, will get a bos off the crupper; <hi>French Lewis</hi>'s made and minted of <hi>Dutch Ducats.</hi> For elective <hi>Princes,</hi> as <hi>Bi≈øhops,</hi> that are onely for life, ≈øeek more to enrich them≈øelves, then to enlarge their Territories, as tho≈øe doe that are hereditary.</p>
               <p>And this is likely, ≈øo far as I can ≈øee, to prove our condition; except <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>„Äà in non-Latin alphabet „Äâ</desc>
                  </gap> appeare in the Tragedy, or God Almighty by ≈øome wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full providence, make a change in the Scene of this War. Which, I confe≈øs, is very deplorable, which way ≈øoever we look; and we are not ≈øo ≈øen≈øible of it now, as we ≈øhall be hereafter. I had thought here to have ≈øit downe a little with a lamentation, but I have been ≈øo large already, that I ≈øhall wholly wave it for the pre≈øent.</p>
               <p>And yet <hi>it is a had wind that blows no good,</hi> we may make this advantage of our mi≈øeries, ≈øo long as we remain amid≈øt our enimies, when a Peace is once concluded; that we may hold them both fair to us, and ≈øo ≈øecure our ≈øelves a little more in quiet, then we perhaps think, by being ready to clo≈øe with either, to the great prejudice of the other.</p>
               <p>And therefore let me freely in≈øert this important and nece≈ø≈øary Caution for <hi>England, That they take heed they do not overdo their work;</hi> and ≈øo far irritate this Republick, that out of a pre≈øent prejudice and pa≈ø≈øion, and al≈øo de≈øpera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their future quietne≈øs from them, they call in the <hi>French,</hi> to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venged of them, though it be to their own ruine.</p>
               <p>I know many are jealous, that this whole War is onely to make the <hi>Prince of Orange</hi> a <hi>Monarch,</hi> and the two Crowns will have no more to do with the States; although I profe≈øs, I am far from thinking, that tho≈øe two Kings and Kingdoms would be at all this expence of blood and trea≈øure for that end onely, and doe believe that if that would ≈øet us in our former condition, it would ≈øoone be a≈ø≈øented unto, not onely by the multitude, but the wi≈øeft men among≈øt us, who know the extraordinary abilities and great capacities of his Highne≈øs. Therefore let me ≈øay it freely without offence, either of Him or his Enimies, that I perceive many lay this for a
<pb facs="tcp:56430:48"/>fundamental maxim, <hi>Better a Prince that hath power to defend us, then one whom we mu≈øt onely defend.</hi> And except my eye-≈øight fail me, ≈øome are fa≈øt at work in preparing materials to build thereon. A word is enough to the wi≈øe, and therefore I will ≈øay no more.</p>
               <p>Nay I will not di≈ø≈øemble my further fears, That if <hi>France</hi> keeps tho≈øe places on the South Sea, and ≈øhould get others lower, either in <hi>Holland</hi> or <hi>Frie≈ølands,</hi> as may capacitate him to incommodate their Trade, though we ≈øhould have a peace for ≈øome time with him, we ≈øhall fall into his hands at la≈øt. For the <hi>French</hi> are already ≈øo near us on every ≈øide, that they hover over us, as a Hawk over the grey, watching onely an opportunity, how they may gra≈øp us in their talons.</p>
               <p>If any ≈øhall here aske me, Why may we not then as well now become <hi>French?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I al≈øo ≈øhall aske ≈øuch one Que≈øtion, which when they ≈øatisfie me in, I al≈øo ≈øhall them. You know certainly you mu≈øt die at la≈øt, (whereas here is onely uncertaine fears) and yet when you are ≈øick, why do you take phy≈øick and u≈øe means for recovery? Is it not becau≈øe you de≈øire to live as long as you can? Doe you not account him a mad man, that will ca≈øt away his life, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he mu≈øt lo≈øe it at the la≈øt? And rightly, becau≈øe who knows what God may doe, and whether he may not recover him, though the di≈øea≈øe be de≈øperate?</p>
               <p>Having ≈øpoke our thoughts concerning the≈øe united, we ≈øhall now ≈øpeak of the <hi>Spani≈øh</hi> Provinces. I have as much ≈ømattering skill in Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øick, I confe≈øs, as would ≈øerve me to make <hi>Charon</hi> a fraight of old Wives; yet am I far from being arrived at the confidence, which I have ob≈øerved in <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>rinal-Doctors.</hi> And yet for once, I will adventure to try the little skill I have, with tho≈øe <hi>State-Mountebanks,</hi> that are ≈øo ≈øecure concerning the <hi>Spani≈øh Netherlands.</hi> For my part, I have ≈øhak't their Water again and again, and can find nothing but ≈øymptoms of death. I ≈øhall onely premi≈øe that I ≈øhall not with an Emperical confidence tell you the time: Kingdoms and States, as well as private per≈øons, ≈øometimes langui≈øh out rather then live their la≈øt. But that they are ≈øo ≈øick, that I ≈øee no hopes of their reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very if this War continues. And I will tell you my feares for the en≈øuing Summer.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The incredible preparations that <hi>France</hi> makes this Winter, both of Men and Money, as if they would ≈øet all at ≈øtake for carrying on the following Summers Wars.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Empire's Army is overmatcht with <hi>Turens.</hi> They know, that we are not in a capacity to recover the Cities we have lo≈øt, and that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not conquer tho≈øe that remaine; ≈øo that their Armies cannot be de≈øigned either for ≈øtrengthning their owne Garri≈øons, or forcing of ours. Except they will ≈øpend a Summers Expedition upon ≈øome incon≈øiderable out Garri≈øons, which I cannot imagin.</p>
               <p n="3">3. I have looked round about in <hi>Europe,</hi> where this ≈øtorme ≈øhould fall,
<pb facs="tcp:56430:49"/>and can ≈øee no place it hovers over, except tho≈øe Provinces, and our ≈øelves.</p>
               <p n="4">4. I con≈øider the eminent advantage <hi>France</hi> hath at pre≈øent by their friend≈øhip with <hi>England;</hi> which I feare he will take.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Allthough I doe not thinke <hi>France</hi> will prevaile by all his endeavors with <hi>England</hi> to breake with <hi>Spaine;</hi> yet I thinke <hi>England</hi> will either be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in doing their owne worke, or not ≈øo quickly breake with <hi>France,</hi> to ≈øtop his carriere in over-running tho≈øe <hi>Netherlands.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6 We ≈øhall either have the Wars continue, or a Peace. If the former as they are, though <hi>England</hi> helps not therein, (for they profes in their Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration to maintaine the Treaty at <hi>Aken</hi>) yea, though they would hinder it, yet I doe not ≈øee how they can practically, if they have not prevented it before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand by their Treaty; nor we to be ≈øure the Wars continuing. If a Peace be concluded, we ≈øhall be forced to for≈øake them; this being the main ground of the quarrel. For if we would have helped <hi>France</hi> to have ruind them, we might have been quiet for ≈øome time at lea≈øt; but becau≈øe we had rather quench, then ≈øet our neighbors hou≈øe on fire, le≈øt ours follow in the flames: <hi>France</hi> hath fallen upon us, and ≈øhall we not then thinke that he will cudgell us into ≈øuch conditions? It is true indeed, if <hi>England</hi> and we come to under≈øtand one another, and our joynt intre≈øt better; we may ≈øuccor them for ≈øome time; but that's not my ≈øuppo≈øal, of the Wars continuing as they are, which in that ca≈øe implies a ≈øtrange complication of di≈øea≈øes, which to me, who knows not their Treaty, ≈øeems incurable.</p>
               <p n="7">7. And where el≈øe they ≈øhould have a≈ø≈øi≈øtance to ≈øave them, if <hi>France</hi> will fall upon them, I ≈øee not. For the Empire cannot, it is well if they can ≈øave them≈øelves. <hi>Spaine</hi> is at a great di≈øtance. May make perhaps ≈øome diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion in <hi>Catalonia,</hi> or ≈øome ≈ømall from <hi>Millan, &amp;c.</hi> But whats that to ≈øave tho≈øe Provinces?</p>
               <p n="8">8. We mu≈øt therefore con≈øider if they can ≈øtand on their owne legs, ≈øo as to with≈øtand their enimies power, and not to be throwne downe thereby. And here we ≈øhall find the number of <hi>Spani≈øh</hi> incon≈øiderable; the <hi>Dutch</hi> very wavering and uncertaine: Some Popi≈øh Zealots thinking <hi>France</hi> can be≈øt carry on their de≈øignes; others betwixt hopes and feares, wi≈øhing they might ≈øee an i≈ø≈øue; and others plainely de≈øpairing of re≈øi≈øtance, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øiring they were over. Their Cities great and untenable, ≈øeverall of them requiring allmo≈øt as many to man them well, as they have <hi>Spani≈øh</hi> in the Countrey. If they can make good <hi>Bruxels, Antwerp, Namur,</hi> and <hi>Oo≈øtend,</hi> for ≈øome time, to ≈øee if the affaires of <hi>Europe</hi> may not alter, it is all I expect. But what ≈øhall become of the whole Countrey, and the re≈øt of the Cities,<note place="margin">De≈øcriptio Lovani.</note> 
                  <hi>Bruges, Mechlin, Gant, Lovaine, &amp;c.</hi> Some of them as large as mo≈øt Cities in <hi>Europe.</hi> Three Noblemen <hi>An.</hi> 1427. (as <hi>Guicciardine</hi> tells us) with great charges, had five of the greate≈øt Cities on this ≈øide the Alpes mea≈øured, and found but, 18 Rods or Perches difference. Of which <hi>Lovaine</hi> and <hi>Gant,</hi> the greate≈øt; <hi>Paris</hi> (within the Walls) and <hi>Liege</hi> alike; <hi>Colen</hi> the lea≈øt. But neglecting to mention the ju≈øt mea≈øure, <hi>Guicciardine</hi> tells us they
<pb facs="tcp:56430:49"/>are 6 <hi>Italian</hi> miles within, and above 8 without the walls. And though this be enough, yet I mu≈øt needs thinke them more. For having had the curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øity to mea≈øure one of them for all, I found it upon a warme walking within the Walls, three full hours by my watch. And be≈øides this, <hi>Paris</hi> and <hi>Liege</hi> are mo≈øt populous, <hi>Colen</hi> next, but the≈øe of the <hi>Netherlands</hi> lea≈øt, ≈øo that I leave any rationall man to judge what number of men they require to maintaine them, for I will not now ≈øtand to make that calculation. Now if he takes the≈øe two great Cities, he is in the heart of <hi>Brabant</hi> and <hi>Flanders,</hi> ≈øo that all the re≈øt will fall of them≈øelves. I conclude therfore, that except the treaty between <hi>France</hi> and <hi>England</hi> ≈øecure them, which is unknowne to me; or that God in his all-wi≈øe Providence, make ≈øome wonderfull chang in the ≈øcene of affairs in Europe, the <hi>Spani≈øh Netherlands</hi> are lo≈øt. Having therefore thus tolled their pa≈ø≈øing bell, we will leave them to Gods mercy, and the King of <hi>France</hi>'s clemency, and ha≈øt us out of them to <hi>France</hi> and <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And here many perhaps will thinke me litle better than madd, to cro≈øs the current opinion of Chri≈øtendom; when I ≈øay that the <hi>Friend≈øhip of France and England is ≈øick at heart, and cannot live long;</hi> and the contrary of that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twene <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Spaine.</hi> But I matter not that, other men have their way of making their mea≈øures, and I have mine. And indeed I thought to have communicated it, but this worke having allready exceeded my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions, and that would be a great digre≈ø≈øion, I would onely tell you my grounds or rea≈øons for the pre≈øent why I thinke ≈øo, and may happily make a particular di≈øcour≈øe of the other hereafter.</p>
               <p>How <hi>France</hi> and <hi>England</hi> came to be ≈øo great friends as to agree to commence, and carry on a War thus far again≈øt us, is not now mine enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; but to ≈øhew there is no ≈øuch ground to di≈øpaire of complianee with <hi>England,</hi> notwith≈øtanding their pre≈øent league with <hi>France,</hi> is my de≈øigne. And for this end I ≈øhall fir≈øt ≈øhew that though this friend≈øhip is faire out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly, each for their own ends; yet that it is not ≈øo cordiall and firme, as many among≈øt us feare it is. And to ≈øay the truth, the con≈øideration hereof, was the fir≈øt dawning of hopes I had, for the Prote≈øtant Intre≈øt, and the good of the≈øe Countries. Now allthough I could mention ≈øome more private expo≈øtulations, and perhaps ≈øome of their Articles, allthough I could by no means, ever procure from either ≈øide, the knowledge of them all: yet I thinke it not fit to mention the≈øe, but ≈øuch things onely as are publick, and others as well as my ≈øelf may know, if they u≈øe their eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øight, and ob≈øervation.</p>
               <p>Let us then omitting all ≈øecrets and my≈øteries of State, which yet are the be≈øt grounds to make a judgement, when certainely knowne; we will onely mention ≈øuch things as are publickly apparent, but being not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øidered in ≈øubordination to Rea≈øons of State, were unu≈øefull to the mo≈øt, for the end I have ob≈øerved them.</p>
               <p>When all <hi>Europe</hi> ≈øtood in doubt what <hi>England</hi> would doe, and all men on
<pb facs="tcp:56430:50"/>their tiptoes with expectation; to ≈øee whether War or Peace, betwixt that Kingdome and the≈øe Countries: upon the <hi>Smyrna</hi>'s Fleet returne, the doubts of many were then decided. The Saturday morning early after the fight, the <hi>Fi≈øcale</hi> ≈øent his footman to tell me they had fought, with ≈øome generalls thereof, and that the Fleet was before the Land: I mu≈øt confes, I ≈øtood amazed at <hi>Holmes</hi>'s furious folly, who had orders onely to bring them up, not to commence a War, the Declaration thereof being not publi≈øhed; allthough to tho≈øe that would not ≈øubmit to ≈øuch orders, it was all one in effect, though not in formalities, which are the greate≈øt plea, that I know of, that the <hi>Engli≈øh</hi> have for that Action. Upon this I began to con≈øider the Rea≈øons of State as to <hi>England,</hi> both dome≈øtick and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign; For I rea≈øoned thus, if this friend≈øhip be ≈øo firme that <hi>England</hi> will goe through with <hi>France</hi> in all their great de≈øignes, I mu≈øt make other mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øures then I had formerly done. But ≈øtill finding all Rea≈øons of State again≈øt this, and tho≈øe jealou≈øies of changing <hi>Religion</hi> and the <hi>Government</hi> in tho≈øe Kingdoms frivolous, (as I have demon≈øtrated) I found all≈øo thereby ≈øtronger grounds of hope for the Prote≈øtant Religion and the common In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre≈øt of <hi>Europe;</hi> and that it was onely a temporary friend≈øhip, out of ≈øome particular peake, or de≈øigne again≈øt the≈øe Provinces, which would have an end when ≈øatisfaction therein was given to that Crowne. Whil≈øt I am bu≈øy in ballancing all the Rea≈øons of State for tho≈øe Kingdoms, and likewi≈øe for their Intre≈øt abroad as comprehen≈øively as I could, the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtants Intre≈øt, the Triple Alliance, the greatnes of <hi>France,</hi> the danger of <hi>England &amp;c.</hi> comes the <hi>Engli≈øh</hi> Declaration of War to mine hands, but without a particular date, contrary to practi≈øe, but wi≈øely to colour what <hi>Holmes</hi> had done. Which having diligently peru≈øed, what I de≈øired fir≈øt to ≈øee, I found la≈øt to my great ≈øatisfaction, and that is that they would <hi>≈øupport the peace made at Aix la Chappelle,</hi> (or <hi>Aken</hi>) <hi>and notwith≈øtanding the pro≈øecution of this War, will maintaine the true intent and ≈øcope of the ≈øaid Treaty, and that in all their Alliances which they have or ≈øhall make in the progres of this War, they have and will take care, to pre≈øerve the ends thereof inviolable unles pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked to the contrary.</hi> Whereby I was fully confirmed in my former opinion, ≈øo that I will now proceed to relate ≈øuch things which have publickly pa≈øt in the management of this War, that are ≈øufficient I thinke to enduce tho≈øe that are unprejudiced, though perhaps not to convince the ob≈øtinate, to be of the ≈øame opinion with my ≈øelfe, and that the friend≈øhip of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>France</hi> is not ≈øo firme as they have feared. Premi≈øing that though all States as Game≈øters mu≈øt and will be cautious in their playing their parts, yet there appeared ≈øtill more then ordinary jealou≈øies of each others friend≈øhip all along, in the management of this War.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is ob≈øerveable that though <hi>France</hi> is the Principall in the War, yet they were ≈øo diffident of <hi>England,</hi> that they would have them fir≈øt to begin it, that ≈øo they might ≈øee them certainly engaged again≈øt us.</p>
               <p n="2">2. When they are both engaged, they tru≈øt not one another, without
<pb facs="tcp:56430:50"/>great <hi>Ho≈øtages</hi> as it were on both ≈øides; the <hi>French</hi> Squadron of Ships with the <hi>Engli≈øh</hi> and the <hi>Duke of Monmouth</hi> with the body of an Army with the <hi>French.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. That body of the <hi>Engli≈øh,</hi> which doubtles ≈øhould have remained to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether under their owne generall Officers conjoyned with the <hi>French</hi> Armie; we know was not tru≈øted by the <hi>French</hi> ≈øo to doe, but were mingled here and there, under the principall command of the <hi>French</hi> Generalls.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The Fleet wherein the <hi>Engli≈øh</hi> had the principall ≈øhare of power and command, onely faced ours at fir≈øt in point of Honour, yet attacqued them not, though they had the wind, whereby they might ea≈øily have done it at their plea≈øure, and al≈øo to their Advantage; but ≈øtood over againe to the <hi>Engli≈øh</hi> coa≈øt. Which fooles thought was want of valour, but wi≈øe men will judge it rea≈øon of State, that they might ≈øtay and ob≈øerve what ≈øucces the <hi>French</hi> had by Land. And had not we fallen upon them, for Rea≈øons of State in tho≈øe circum≈øtances and Government of the≈øe Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, that are well knowne, I thinke they would have done, as litle as they could for <hi>France;</hi> to have fought us to this day.</p>
               <p n="5">5. After that fight, though they knew ≈øeverall of our Ships were laid up, and ≈øome thou≈øands of men called out of the Fleet, yet notwith≈øtanding all the Summer after for many weeks, they attempted nothing again≈øt us with their Fleet. Intending doubtles to doe their owne worke, as they then ≈øaw <hi>France</hi> did theirs.</p>
               <p n="6">6. How the <hi>Engli≈øh</hi> were ≈øtartled, at the <hi>French</hi>'s coming to <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>trecht</hi> was very apparent, which we have formerly mentioned.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Why might not <hi>England,</hi> as well as the re≈øt of the World, thinke that <hi>We≈øel, Rijnberg, Skenker-≈øcon≈øe,</hi> and the re≈øt of our ≈øtrong out Garri≈øons might give the <hi>French</hi> ≈øufficient worke? and the <hi>French</hi> on the contrary, who had laid their traines before hand, know that when they came to fire them, there was no feare they would mis, and they ≈øhould faile of having tho≈øe places? Yea why may they not de≈øigne by this meanes to breake both our powers ≈øo by Sea, that they may ri≈øe up to contend with either of us? I am ≈øure the≈øe things are very u≈øuall with Princes and States, and exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of this kind are infinite. Why may we not then thinke that <hi>England</hi> might hereby de≈øigne to breake <hi>France</hi>'s power by Land; and <hi>France Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands</hi> power and ours al≈øo by Sea? How often the≈øe two Crowns have played ≈øuch like games with one another formerly; when <hi>England</hi> had ≈øooting in <hi>France,</hi> is apparent from the Hi≈øtories of both Nations. But we will ≈øpeake of that which more nearly concerns our ≈øelves, and within our own knowledge. In our fir≈øt War with <hi>England</hi> I ob≈øerved, what influence <hi>Don Alonzo,</hi> the Re≈øident for <hi>Spaine</hi> at <hi>London,</hi> had, to fomer tho≈øe jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lou≈øies that that Common-wealth had of this, that it was the Kings cau≈øe, which this Republick by meanes of the <hi>Orange</hi> Family had e≈øpou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øes, and what a≈ø≈øi≈øtance <hi>Spaine,</hi> (which fir≈øt publickly acknowledged that Common-weath) would afford them, &amp;c. And when we were both en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged,
<pb facs="tcp:56430:51"/>how the <hi>Spani≈øh</hi> drew their Forces towards our Frontiers, as if they al≈øo would fall upon us; and when we declined, withdrew them againe, to encourage us both to continue the War. And in our ≈øecond War, if <hi>France</hi> had not a great hand both in contriving and continuing it, wi≈øemen are much deceived, and the French mi≈ørepre≈øented to the World. By what inducements they per≈øwaded both ≈øides to a willingnes to that War, I li≈øt not mention, nor is there much nece≈ø≈øity thereof, they being ≈øo well knowne to ≈øeverall of both Nations. What a hand they had in its continuation, we may ea≈øily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, if we recollect but what pa≈ø≈øed therein. When the <hi>Engli≈øh</hi> in the fir≈øt Battel had bearen us, <hi>France</hi> being onely a <hi>Spectator</hi> to ballance <hi>England,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes our Second; and <hi>Mon≈øieur,</hi> the Kings onely Brother, and his Lady, <hi>Englands</hi> onely Si≈øter, were not permitted to u≈øe any publick expre≈ø≈øions of joy by Bonefires, or otherwi≈øe for their Brother the <hi>Duke of Yorks</hi> Victory over <hi>Opdam.</hi> Their Fleet under <hi>de Duke of Bauford</hi> ≈øhall come to our a≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øi≈øtance, which occa≈øiond the dividing of the <hi>Engli≈øhe</hi>'s, by which meanes and <hi>Monks</hi> precipitancy (who would needs fight contrary to the advice of the cheif and be≈øt Commanders in the Fleet, as <hi>A≈øcough</hi> told us in the <hi>Hague</hi>) the <hi>Engli≈øh</hi> are beaten by us. And to boye up <hi>England</hi> againe, a private League is made betweene the two Crownes, as I have formerly declared from an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Author. So that the≈øe tricks of State are u≈øuall, though not di≈øcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by every eye; nor dare I cen≈øure them allwayes for ≈øinfull, except I ≈øee manife≈øtly foule play, becau≈øe I know not the Rea≈øons of State, which are the Grounds of their proceedings.</p>
               <p>Having thus ≈øhewne, and I thinke ≈øufficiently, <hi>that the friend≈øhip of</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land <hi>and</hi> France <hi>is ≈øick at heart;</hi> I ≈øhall now proceed to ≈øhew, <hi>that it cannot live long;</hi> but if <hi>France</hi> goes on, <hi>will and mu≈øt die quickly.</hi>

               <p>On the otherhand <hi>France</hi> was not a≈øleep, or awanting to pro≈øecute their intre≈øt, in fomenting, promoting, and carrying on tho≈øe divi≈øions in the≈øe <hi>Low Countries;</hi> to breake downe the power of <hi>Spaine,</hi> into who≈øe hands they had fallen by marriage (as we have ≈øaid) and to remove the ob≈øtacle, which the≈øe Provinces con≈øtantly were, to their advancing their de≈øignes. For which end they continually a≈ø≈øi≈øted us, and whil≈øt they pretended to fight our Battells; at our charges they really fought their owne. And le≈øt the Hou≈øe of <hi>Au≈øtria</hi> ≈øo nearly allied to <hi>Spaine,</hi> ≈øhould afford them further a≈ø≈øi≈øtance, they ingage <hi>Sweden</hi> to invade the <hi>Empire,</hi> and give the <hi>Emperor</hi> worke at home, allowing A.

               <p>
                  <hi>Sweden</hi> was to pluck the plumes of the <hi>Roman Eagle,</hi> when he had clipt the wings of his Neighbours, that they might not fly upon the prey he left
<pb facs="tcp:56430:57"/>behind.

               <p>
                  <hi>France</hi> was to pull downe <hi>Spaine</hi> by Land, with his own forces, and ≈øuch as the Protector could ≈øpare.

               <p>The Protector was to bring downe <hi>Spaine</hi> by Sea, which <hi>he ≈øaid he would do, or he and his ≈øhould live on bread and water.</hi> Intending all≈øo to carrie on the de≈øigne, which <hi>Sidney, Rawleight</hi> and ≈øeveral of the wi≈øe≈øt men of the <hi>Indies;</hi> but as ≈øhe had too many irons in the fire to carry on that worke, ≈øo how he mi≈øcarried in it, is ≈øufficiently knowne. And indeed he had broke <hi>Spaines</hi> Naval power much more then he did, allthough he did a great deale at <hi>Tenerif</hi> and el≈øewhere, had it not been for a ≈ømall accident that happend, which was this.

               <p>Thus you ≈øee what great things a little blind zeale may doe.

               <p>But the≈øe three lived not long to goe on with the≈øe de≈øignes, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it was well for the world they did not. <hi>Oliver</hi> went fir≈øt, at which <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarine,</hi> was ≈øecretly glad, ≈øaying when the newes was brought him as he was at play, <hi>there's then a fortunate foole gon.</hi> But this was but to trample upon a dead lion, whom he ≈øo ridiculou≈øly feared before, that his greate≈øt Confidents made them≈øelves privately merry therewith.

But though the crafty Cardinal was no coward, yet thus feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and timorou≈øly was he cautious for Him, whom I know he hated above all Mortals, and that Common-wealth above all people in the world; as I can many wayes make apparent, if it was of any importance to the publick.</p>
               <p>But to be briefe, <hi>Olivers</hi> other two <hi>Con≈øorts</hi> followed after him quickly, and the≈øe three Conquerors, being cut of by death, who kept all Chri≈øtendome in aw whil≈øt they lived, the world had a little quiet, till <hi>France</hi> got a hor≈øeback again in <hi>Flanders.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But betwixt and that time was that great change in <hi>England</hi> by the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull providence of God in the re≈øtoration of his Maje≈øty, by which meanes the <hi>French</hi> got <hi>Dunkirke</hi> again into their hands, and were therby ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacitated, the better to carry on their worke again≈øt the≈øe Countries.

<pb facs="tcp:56430:58"/>the plea≈øantnes of the pro≈øpect, that I thought for that it might compare with any Hou≈øe I had ≈øeen, knowing no place in <hi>England</hi> except above <hi>Greenwich,</hi> that I thought comparable to it, upon which the dome≈øtick had the confidence, perceiving me a ≈øtranger, to tell me I could not thence ≈øee <hi>Dunkirke;</hi> for the Commonality had Chri≈øtened it, and made <hi>Dunkirke</hi> the Godfather, calling the Hou≈øe after its name.

I will onely ≈øay this, that I know a per≈øon hath weighed that ≈øo well, that I ≈øhall carry this chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge for him, That if any Gentleman, <hi>Engli≈øh</hi> or <hi>French,</hi> plea≈øes fairely to ≈øtate this Que≈øtion <hi>in hypothe≈øi,</hi> according to the circum≈øtances of tho≈øe times, let him take which ≈øide thereof he plea≈øes, and u≈øe what weapons he will (and I think thats very faire) and he ≈øhall not want an <hi>Antagoni≈øt,</hi> that ≈øhall fight him fairely, whether he plea≈øes to appeare in <hi>Roman buf,</hi> or in his halfe ≈øhirt made of his owne mothers language, upon the publick Thea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the World. And truly his de≈øigne is ≈øo hone≈øt, I dare be his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purgator, and being a litle acquainted with it, I ≈øhall tell you briefly: It is to let men ≈øee, how hard it is ≈øometimes to di≈øcerne on which ≈øide the true intre≈øt of State lies, (there being ≈øo many circum≈øtances con≈øiderable, which often in the Scale of Policy, weigh heavier then that which by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtanders think the maine) and therby all≈øo to check the ≈øawcines of every ≈øhopkeeper, who like the litle <hi>Spani≈øh Dons,</hi> will be cen≈øuring Princes Coun≈øels, and condemning Mini≈øters of State, though they are ignorant of the grounds of their Actions, and much more of that which is true policy.</p>
               <p>Having thus ≈øhewne the true State of <hi>France,</hi> and its continuall growing greatnes downe to the times of his pre≈øent Maje≈øty, who hath not onely got <hi>Dunkirke,</hi> regained <hi>Lorraigne,</hi> conquered a great part of <hi>Flanders</hi> from the <hi>Spani≈øh</hi> but three Provinces all≈øo entirely from the States: It will clearely fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low to be the Common Intre≈øt of <hi>Europe</hi> to oppo≈øe <hi>France</hi> in their future pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gre≈øs, except they meane to follow our fate.</p>
               <p>I had thought to have been larger heerein then I ≈øhall, in regard my paines is heerein in part prevented, by the Authour of la <hi>France Politique</hi> from page 470 to 525, or the end: And having been ≈øo long allready, I may happily hereafter, di≈øcour≈øe this more largely in another language. I ≈øhall therefore be brie≈ø in that which remaines.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Empire,</hi> though greatly concerned, (the <hi>French</hi> being not onely nigh them, but among them, and having got ≈øuch places of the <hi>Rhyne,</hi> capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citated to pas over all at their plea≈øure) yet ≈øeeme a ≈øleepe, and are therefore to be rou≈øed; and if no words will doe it, yet let the alarmes of War rai≈øe them, and the ≈øtrength of their enimies make them combine, le≈øt fighting ≈øingly, they be all foiled. I ≈øhall not ≈øtand to particularize, but ≈øurely the <hi>Duke of Newburgh</hi> and <hi>Prince of Liege</hi> that have been mo≈øt guilty in let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb facs="tcp:56430:59"/>the <hi>French</hi> have pa≈ø≈øage through, and quarter in their Countries; will have the fir≈øt cau≈øe to repent, except they meane to ≈øell them to the Crowne of <hi>France;</hi> which yet may happily beat them downe in price, now they are ≈øo impoveri≈øhed by them. For though <hi>Gulick</hi> belonging to <hi>Newburg</hi> be ≈øtrong, the Ca≈øtle e≈øpecially (which was the Patterne to that of <hi>Antwerp</hi>) yet it is on dry ground, ea≈øily approachable, and in a champaigne Country and not relievable from a ≈øiege. And if that ≈ømall City once be taken, all that plea≈øant corne Country may cry out,
<q>
                     <l>Impius haec tam culta novalia miles habebit,</l>
                     <l>Barbarus has ≈øegetes!</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>And though <hi>Liege</hi> (or <hi>Luyke</hi>) be great and populous, and the de≈øperate≈øt people in all times, that I know in <hi>Europe;</hi> yet <hi>vana e≈øt ≈øine viribus ira,</hi> the City hath ≈øuch hills overhanging it, that it is neither ≈øtrong by its ≈øituation, nor can hope of relief if they ≈øhould be di≈øtre≈ø≈øed, except it be by a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federacy from others; and if this ≈øingle City be lo≈øt, all their Country will be ≈øo quickly.</p>
               <p>Yea not onely tho≈øe on this ≈øide the <hi>Rhijne,</hi> but even all the re≈øt will quickly find, that if the wings of the <hi>Roman Eagle</hi> be clipt, and prove too ≈øhort to ≈øhaddow her young Ones; they will ≈øoone become a prey to the power of <hi>France,</hi> and will be throwne out of their ne≈øts as ≈øpurious, if they cannot ≈øtedfa≈øtly behold the ri≈øing ≈øun, and will not receive their warmth from his beames.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Spaine</hi> is ≈øen≈øible enough of their concernments, knowing that not onely their <hi>Netherlands,</hi> but their <hi>Indies</hi> and <hi>Italy</hi> lie at the ≈øtake: for if <hi>France</hi> be Ma≈øter of all the≈øe <hi>Provinces,</hi> they will ≈øoone be ≈øo of the <hi>Indies</hi> all≈øo; and the <hi>Dutch</hi> fetch thence, the <hi>Spani≈øh</hi> Gold for the <hi>French Crowne;</hi> and the <hi>Lilies of France,</hi> be the Royall flower, in all their Gardens both in <hi>Italia</hi> and <hi>Sicilia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>England,</hi> though now their Confederate, cannot but know what danger they are in for their Trade; which is the be≈øt jewel in that Crowne, and the greate≈øt darling of that Kingdome. And therefore it is high time ≈øurely, that the Soveraigne ≈øtraiten not his intere≈øt at home, by e≈øpou≈øing any particular party; nor the ≈øubjects quarrel about Ceremonies, when the ≈øub≈øtance of Religion is ≈øo endangered; that ≈øo they may timou≈øly looke abroad, before it be too late and all be lo≈øt; and his Maje≈øty in due time retire from <hi>France,</hi> and make him≈øelf and ≈øucce≈ø≈øors (as is much de≈øired) the Head of all the Prote≈øtant party in <hi>Europe.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Denmark</hi> ≈øurely knows, that if the <hi>Empire</hi> fall they cannot ≈øtand: but mu≈øt lo≈øe both their toll in the <hi>Sound,</hi> and what by Land the <hi>French</hi> plea≈øes.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Republick</hi> of all others is mo≈øt immediately concerned, for he is blind that ≈øees not, whatever ≈øome may flatter them≈øelves, that the <hi>French</hi> intend nothing les then reducing of us to their obedience.</p>
               <p>And when this is done, and they advance upwards in the Empire; what are <hi>Stratsburg, Colen, Aken, Breme, Hamburg,</hi> and the re≈øt of the <hi>Han≈øe
<pb facs="tcp:56430:59"/>Townes,</hi> and free Cities, but as ≈øo many mor≈øels, ea≈øily eaten up and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured?</p>
               <p>Yea their con≈øtant friends and Allies may looke to them≈øelves.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sweden</hi> how they will ≈øave their <hi>Bi≈øhoprick of Breme, Pomeren,</hi> and what lies on this ≈øide the <hi>Baltick:</hi> and how they will ≈øell their Copper, which is the Staple commodity of their owne Countrey. And in ≈øtead of the <hi>French</hi> Crownes, which is now their u≈øuall money among≈øt them; when that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome hath no more neede of their ≈øervice; they may carry their owne Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per coyne on their backs to pay a collation, or laden a hor≈øe when they travel, to pay for 2 or 3 good nights lodging.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Savoy</hi> knows he is at <hi>France</hi>'s mercy, and therefore dances after their pipe, endeavouring to ≈øave him≈øelfe by his devotion. But they may remember the Lamb in the Fable, who when the Wolf above quarreld him, becau≈øe he troubled the water; an≈øwered that could not be ≈øo, in regard it de≈øcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to him, not from him; the Wolf then ≈øaid, he had reviled him 6 months before, to which the Lamb replying, he was not then borne. But thy Father then did ≈øaith He, and that's cau≈øe enough for the ≈øons ≈øuffering.</p>
               <p>For <hi>Switzerland,</hi> though their mountaines and Poverty may ≈øecure per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps their Countrey: yet what ≈øhall ≈øecure their liberty, which con≈øi≈øts in an equality among≈øt them? or what ≈øhall ≈øecure the. Religion of the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te≈øtant Cantons?</hi> or the good pay which the <hi>Popi≈øh</hi> have long had, for their ≈øervice in the Wars of <hi>France?</hi> They mu≈øt then be content with what they can get, or be turned to graze on their owne mountaines.</p>
               <p>And thus you ≈øee what nece≈ø≈øity there is that the <hi>French</hi> be kept within bounds: and con≈øequently. that the ballance of <hi>Europe,</hi> be both brought and held in a greater equality. For intre≈øts changing continually with the revolution of times; and Kingdoms and Commonwealths, Cities and pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, having their youth ≈øtrength and old age, as well as particular per≈øons: If le≈ø≈øer Powers combine not together, they ≈øingly become like the ≈ømaller fi≈øhes, ea≈øily ≈øwallowed up and devoured by the greater. Thus the league between the King of <hi>Naples,</hi>

                  <note n="*" place="margin">E≈ø≈øay (or ≈øermo fidelis) <hi>19.</hi>
                  </note> ≈øaies plainely that the contrary opinion is not to be received, and many other moderne Authors concur heerein, be≈øides the many Precedents of States that have made preventive Wars, as the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> again≈øt the
<pb facs="tcp:56430:60"/>
                  <hi>Arhenians</hi> of old, and many e≈øpecially of later times; and the Arguments for it are not contemptible: yet notwith≈øtanding I am rather of <hi>Grotius</hi>'s opinion,<note place="margin">De jure belli &amp; pac. l. <hi>2.</hi> c. <hi>1.</hi> ¬ß. <hi>17.</hi> &amp;c. <hi>22.</hi> ¬ß. 5.</note> that neither our owne feares and jealou≈øies, nor the growing greatnes of others, are ≈øufficient cau≈øes of warring again≈øt them.</p>
               <p>But indeed neither of the≈øe is the cau≈øe we plead, but the following, which we will maintaine <hi>jure gentium</hi> or by the law of Nations to be ju≈øt and equitable.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Let any Kingdome or Common-wealth grow as great, as they can by Gods ble≈ø≈øing; yet ≈øo long as they keep them≈øelves, within the bounds of ju≈øtice and equity with others; there is no ju≈øt cau≈øe of breaking downe their power by War. For jealou≈øie that we may thereby ≈øuffer, is no ≈øuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient ground for us to fight them. It being with publick as wel as private ≈øafety, as Phy≈øitians ≈øay it is with our health, tollerably well, but never ab≈øolute and perfect. And therefore again≈øt ≈øuch force as we may feare, we mu≈øt tru≈øt the Providence of God, and u≈øe lawfull meanes cautiou≈øly to prevent dangers; our Saviour having taught all Chri≈øtians to u≈øe <hi>the wi≈ødome of the Serpent with the innocencie of the dove,</hi> and cur≈øed be they that ≈øeperates, what Chri≈øt hath joyned together.</p>
               <p n="2">2. When Neighbor Nations ≈øee the growing power of any, whence they have ju≈øt cau≈øe of jealou≈øie: they ought to combine together; that ≈øo they may prevent the dangers they feare. And if any of the Confederates be unju≈øtly invaded, they have all a ju≈øt cau≈øe of War again≈øt the Agre≈ø≈øor. As the <hi>Italians</hi> being jealous of the <hi>Venetians</hi> Power,<note place="margin">Guicciar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dine's Hi≈øt. of Ital. l. <hi>1.</hi>
                  </note> leagued them≈øelves for their owne defence, ≈øo that though the Republick of Venice was too ≈øtrong for any of them ≈øingly, yet being far too weake for them all, was kept with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in bounds, and they thereby wi≈øely ≈øecured them≈øelves.</p>
               <p n="3">3. When any Potentate that is ≈øtronger then his Neighbors aggre≈ø≈øes any of them, the re≈øt ought to Confederate; and if his cau≈øe be ju≈øt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell him to accept of due ≈øatisfaction, and if he will not, his cau≈øe then becoming unju≈øt, and much more if it was ≈øo originally, to make War again≈øt him. As the <hi>Italians</hi> did again≈øt the <hi>French,</hi> when they under <hi>Charles</hi> the 8 were invaded. And the <hi>Triple Alliance</hi> of late, when the ≈øame nation had taken the <hi>County of Burgundie,</hi> commonly called the <hi>French Comt√©</hi> and invaded <hi>Flanders,</hi> both which belong to the Crowne of <hi>Spaine.</hi> Thus our <hi>Neighbors</hi> all≈øo ≈øhould now allie with us, in point of hone≈øt intre≈øt; that ≈øo we may reduce <hi>France</hi> to keepe within bounds, le≈øt we ≈øhould all be ruind by them.</p>
               <p>I ≈øhall make the≈øe things plaine by familiar example. The ballancing of Nations is like to that of boats: they that by an even <hi>poize,</hi> might all ≈øit ≈øafe in a boate on a rough Sea, by the ri≈øing up of ≈øome are all in danger to be drowned. In ≈øuch ca≈øe therefore the company perceiving, a quarrel likely to ari≈øe among≈øt ≈øome of them, mu≈øt either agree before hand to keepe them quiet; or if the conte≈øt come ≈øuddenly, afterwards re≈øolve to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, to compel tho≈øe that are injurious, to keepe their place; and if
<pb facs="tcp:56430:60"/>they will not, throw them over-board. And this ballancing of powers, I ≈øhall defend by the Fundamentall Law of Nature <hi>≈øelfe-pre≈øervation,</hi> and from the Law of Nations, as well as from the Word of God, and back the ≈øame by many approved examples; if any one hath a mind to conte≈øt with me heerein.</p>
               <p>Lets ≈øee a litle <hi>how,</hi> and <hi>by whom,</hi> ≈øtronger powers mu≈øt be ballanced, and I ≈øhall give a relea≈øe to your patience.</p>
               <p n="1">1. By the Confederacy of weaker Nations that are their Neighbors, and are in danger thereby of being overcome, as we have allready ≈øhewne.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Or by a Neutrall Nation that re≈øerve them≈øelves free, to league with the weaker, when they ≈øee them injured by the ≈øtronger powers. And this was the Ancient policy of <hi>England,</hi>

                  <hi>Sect. 13.</hi> The Conclu≈øion of the whole Di≈øcour≈øe.</head>
               <p>I Have now done, and it is high time, having been much larger then I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended at fir≈øt; allthough not ≈øo large by far, as I found, being once entred upon the Argument, I might be. And yet, I hope, it will not be tedious to the Reader. Inregard of the novelty of the matter, which though daily di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour≈øt of by many yet never writ of by any. And in regard of the u≈øefulnes thereof. For though old men are apt to dote upon the brats of their brain, as well as their body: Yet, if I be not deceived, this Di≈øcour≈øe, may through Gods ble≈ø≈øing, prove in≈øtrumentall in begetting a better under≈øtanding between both Nations, (for which end I have publi≈øhed it in both Languages) by ≈øhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them their concernments, it being the <hi>Chariot of Intre≈øt</hi> which all Princes and States <hi>Jehu-like</hi> furiou≈øly drive; and all≈øo ≈øerve to cleare up ≈øome State Controver≈øies, that are not ea≈øily di≈øcerned by vulgar eyes, to di≈øcover the former and pre≈øent ≈øtate of affaires among≈øt us, and mo≈øt parts of <hi>Europe,</hi> and give a pro≈øpect through this intricate, darke, and cloudy War, with what hopes we may have concerning its i≈ø≈øue: And be≈øides the≈øe things, I thinke the clearnes of ≈øtile, which I have u≈øed to deliver my minde in, may make it bes nautious to ≈øome, who are apt to mind the ≈øwadling cloths more then the Child.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:56430:61"/>
               <p>I know medation betwixt men in pa≈ø≈øion is a very thankles office; and that the freedome I have u≈øed, will both plea≈øe and di≈øplea≈øe many ≈øorts of men on all ≈øides; but yet when mens pa≈ø≈øions are allayed, I doe not doubt but they will thinke better of the hone≈øt de≈øignes of the Author. And yet I have endeavoured to give as little offence as I could po≈ø≈øibly to any; but if any notwith≈øtanding count me their enimie, becau≈øe I tell them the truth, I cannot helpe it: for I never accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them worthy to write, that are by a≈øt with feare, or favour and flattery. Yea, I per≈øwade my ≈øelfe, that there is not any ingenuous man, or brave Gentleman even of the <hi>French</hi> Nation, who≈øe de≈øignes I cheifly oppo≈øe; but they will acknowledge it lawfull for an enimie, to fight them with a pen as well as a pike, and that I am a very civil Adver≈øary, having both fairely fought them, and with their owne wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons, having made u≈øe of their Authors, and not ours, throughout my di≈øcour≈øe.</p>
               <p>I ≈øhall not now throw downe the gantlet and make a challenge, yet if any under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take to refute me concerning the intre≈øt of the≈øe Countries, which I thinke wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy an≈øwering, I ≈øhall not faile to doe it. As for my <hi>Conjectures,</hi> I both account and call them <hi>probable,</hi> and therfore being not po≈øitive and dogmaticall in them, I leave them with their Rea≈øons to the Reader to judge. But if ≈øome pa≈ø≈øionate per≈øon thinks with railing at the <hi>French, Engli≈øh,</hi> or the Author hereof, and carping at ≈øome particulars to refute me; I ≈øhall tell them before hand I was never bred, to give any one ill language, and ≈øhall onely an≈øwer them with ≈øilence and contempt. Or if any well meaning ≈øcholler that hath read perhaps hone≈øt <hi>Keckermans,</hi> or ≈øome others learned <hi>Sy≈øtema Politicum;</hi> I ≈øhall onely ≈ømile in my ≈øleeve, having all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes accounted Booke policy alone, mere pedantry; and allthough no man va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lew's learning more then my ≈øelfe, yet he mu≈øt know men as well as bookes, and the world well, that will write of the≈øe things. Yet if any will bring Rea≈øons of State, and clearely delivered, as I thinke I have done, and fairely ventilate my opinion, I ≈øhall promi≈øe him as faire an An≈øwer, for <hi>truth never feared a faire tryall.</hi>
